## Die Geschichte der Region

The History of Berma-Tal exist as a collection of theories, humors and stories told various people. Berma-tal used to be a uninhabited region where many deadly monsters roamed and were no man had returned from its jungles let alone settle in the region. Legends say that this is the region were the monsters of our world originally came from and that it is also the birthplace of any new monsters that come into existance in our world. The most common believe regarding Berma-tals current inhabitants is  that the people used to belong to a monster hunting organization called the Zamrak warriors. These warriors are a collection of people who have existed for hundreds of years and are known for hunting down monsters that terrorize the common people. During the age were monster hunting became a common occurrence in Eldria, as almost every citizens took up arms and hunted down monster. During this time period the Zamrak warrior were less and less needed and the started to lose a large amount of political support. The principalities all grew in strength and security and soon none wanted monster hunters that weren't under their control. It wasn't long before they had no other choice but to seek a new place for themselves.

It was during this time that a Zamrak champion by the name of Ioco Emeric Tholy led the warriors. Tholy promised the warriors that if they were to follow him through the deserts and past the mountainranges of Dunstspitzen then they would find a new promising land. Tholy was a fine warrior and leader, however he was quite a mysterious man. Nowadays people believe that he was controlled by Ciresh the bloodgod and that they were purposly led into the region. Some People believe that Ciresh made a deal with the bloodgod Ga'ar to extract the Zamrak warriors from Eldria and to place them into Berma-tal were they could turn the warriors into their puppets. It is unknown what Ga'ar promised Ciresh for this action. Some people speculated Ciresh was promised free reign over Eldria to torture her victims in her sadistic ways uninterupted by other bloodgods. However another theory exists that speculates that Ga'ar promised Ciresh a collaboration in which they would go against Hartemus.

However Ciresh didn't follow through on her promise to hand over the warriors to Ga'ar, which coursed the Zamrak warriors to worship various Monsters. Exactly one monster per Tribe. It is unknown how far Ciresh influence is over the tribesmen of Berma-tal today, but the tribes all worship their own monster god nowadays and some people belive that Ciresh has done this out of spite for Ga'ar. Tribes of the former Zamrak warriors can now be found all throughout Berma-Tal but there exists no cooperation between them. Every tribe is out for the other ones and they only look out for themselves. War is being waged on a daily basis and it seems like peace will never find its way into Berma-Tal.



## Wirtschaftliche Lage

There is no economy to be found in Bermatal, as no tribes wishes to cooperate or trade with each other. Each tribe creates their own necessities and goods by themselves and for themselves and if any item is scavenged from another tribe then the tribesmen will either fight for it or it is given to the leaders of the tribe as tribute. Whatever happens to the item afterwards is up to the leader themselv.

Furthermore each tribe has a great reserve of food, as they often hunt down large monster, which they later on eat and each tribe normally has a gathering ground were the scavenge for other sources of food. Wood is the main building resource used by the tribes and there is plenty of it for each tribe. Berma-tals people don't create large structures and they seldom make new ones so they will never run out of wood. But it is known that the tribes often lake strong tools due to them not having any proper ways for processing ores. Furthermore they dont have other goods like ceramic, which has stopped them from growing as people and and expanding into other aspects of life.

The "" tribe to the north, the "" tribe to the south and the "" tribe to the west. These clans controll the most land and dominate most of the other tribes around them. However none of the 3 great clans are able to beat each other as they are in a deadly lock due to their mutations working well or poorly against the other tribes. This stalemate is believe to have existed for hundreds of years by now and each clan is getting more desperate to beat the other. 

Other important aspects include the threat of strong looming monster in the region. Every tribe might be experience in killing monster but some threats are just to much to handle for one tribe.
