Statton used to be its own Führstentum however 500 years ago it was conquered by Aerlham and ever since Statton and its surrounding areas is under Aerlhams control. The Area around Statton used to be counted among the most peacefully areas in Eldria, were most people flourish, however after the empire attacked Eldria it saw a turn for the first. Prostitutes became very common und other crimes such as drug dealing and gangfights as well. Another important aspect of Statton is the massive empire Fort "". Here many new soldiers are trained and it is known for being one of the biggest recruit places for eldrian citizens. However there are 3 factions. The soldiers loyal to the empire, the soldiers loyal to Eldira and additional mercenaries from Grenzland that are brought into the cities to help with its various problems. These mercenaries are supposed to protect the city but are actually extremly corrupt. This doesn't help with the fact that the latter two groups often clash with each other in and around Statton, which in turn create negative efects for its citizens. SIMON: 6 groups that clash. Eldira drunkards, imperial Drunkards, City guards, Prositution and drug gangs, imperial petrol

### Infrastruktur

Eldria is known for being one of the most well connected regions in the world. Almost each city and town is connected to a road that leads to one of the major cities and each city has a road leading to another one. The biggest and most maintained road is the road from Aerlham leading to Gent. These two principalities are the most important and strongest in Eldria and as such many people and goods travel between them all year around. The next most safest and heavily guarded road is the one leading from Aerlham to ""(the city at the border of Eldria and Grenzland). Many Kaiserliche soldiers travel this road and they often accompany transporters carrying goods or people to the region. Another important destionation with many roads leading to it is Wandia. Wandia is a central part of ELdria and many people and armies travel to it. While Eldria is said to have many roads, they are not always the most safest for there are often wars being waged between the many principalities and they often cause a lot disarray. Futhermore many bandits and other unsavoury groups often roam eldria and attack people on the roads

## Wirtschaftliche Lage

Eldria is a place filled with a rich cutlture and numerous people however due to all these people and the many conflict that they create with each other, there is little room for consistant trade between all the factions. Moreover it is not uncommon for the armies to burn down villages and other trade installations, which has a negativ impact on the trade and production in the region. Because of this there are few profound and important resource hub but instead there are many smaller ones spread throughtout the entirety of Eldria. 

### Die Ressourcen der Region

he resources, which are most plentiful and important in Eldria are Holz, Zutaten, Felle, Stoffe. Eldria has a great love for hunting animals and many people creat allocated hunting spots for nobles to use. But killing animals is not only reserved for the Nobles. Many people have farms for collecting leather and pelts from animals in all parts of the region. Eldria even has a history of preparing mosnter hunting spots, however this practice is nowadays illegal but some nobles still search for the thrill of hunting monsters.

Eldria also has a lot of forests were they gather wood for building, heating and other areas were wood is acquired. Some of the most interesting wood can be found around Austen. Here yellow, orange and red trees can be found. These trees have special looks and properties and are loved by many of the nobles of Eldria

## Soziopolitische Lage 

Eldria is whirlpool of political plots and wars. Tension can be found throughout the entire region. Be it from the Kaiserreich and its soldier trying to occupy the region to the struggle between Gent and Aerlham or even the tension coming from Silva Nacia and the wood elfs. One thing is to be sure of though. If you are a noble in Eldria then there is never a moment of rest for you. War is the norm in Eldria and many factions and principalities  have a large history with each other that cause them to fight with each other and no corner of the region is outside of the reach of the sword and torch.

After the fall of Harschell most of the people of Eldria started hunt monsters so that it would never happened again. The nobles also joined and after many years it became a rival game/sport between them. Soon people started to raise monsters for the nobles to hunt.
