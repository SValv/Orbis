### Infrastruktur

Eldria is known for being one of the most well connected regions in the world. Almost each city and town is connected to a road that leads to one of the major cities and each city has a road leading to another one. The biggest and most maintained road is the road from Aerlham leading to Gent. These two principalities are the most important and strongest in Eldria and as such many people and goods travel between them all year around. The next most safest and heavily guarded road is the one leading from Aerlham to ""(the city at the border of Eldria and Grenzland). Many Kaiserliche soldiers travel this road and they often accompany transporters carrying goods or people to the region. Another important destionation with many roads leading to it is Wandia. Wandia is a central part of ELdria and many people and armies travel to it. While Eldria is said to have many roads, they are not always the most safest for there are often wars being waged between the many principalities and they often cause a lot disarray. Futhermore many bandits and other unsavoury groups often roam eldria and attack people on the roads

## Wirtschaftliche Lage

Eldria is a place filled with a rich cutlture and numerous people however due to all these people and the many conflict that they create with each other, there is little room for consistant trade between all the factions. Moreover it is not uncommon for the armies to burn down villages and other trade installations, which has a negativ impact on the trade and production in the region. Because of this there are few profound and important resource hub but instead there are many smaller ones spread throughtout the entirety of Eldria.

## Soziopolitische Lage 

Eldria is whirlpool of political plots and wars. Tension can be found throughout the entire region. Be it from the Kaiserreich and its soldier trying to occupy the region to the struggle between Gent and Aerlham or even the tension coming from Silva Nacia and the wood elfs.

War is the norm in Eldria and many factions and principalities  have a large history with each other that cause them to fight with each other and no corner of the region is outside of the reach of the sword and torch.
