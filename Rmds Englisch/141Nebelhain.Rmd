The stories about the Misty Grove go back a long way. The story of its origin is unclear. According to oral legends of orcs and dwarves, there was once a risiege dwarven metropolis located above the plains of the Misty Grove. When the dwarves dug too deep, first the gold in the chambers melted into large lumps and then a volcano devoured all the living in the dwarf city, which is dismissed by researchers as humbug. However, researchers clearly state that a dwarf city, which was skilled in casting and testing cannons. However, due to the explosion, rivers flowing underground were diverted in such a way that the former expanses were flooded.

Since 700 years ago, when this event took place, the former plains with partly dense forests have turned into a huge swamp-like area.

The depth of the water is sometimes unpredictable and allows only light boats with shallow draft to pass.

For foot soldiers it is an arduous and exhausting march. In addition to mosquitoes and leeches and several previously unknown diseases, reports of loss of sanity stand out.

Up to now, little has been reported about this disease, which temporarily affects the mind of those affected. The symptoms usually subside quickly after leaving the misty grove. Called Madaria, it also quickly destroys advances in a coordinated manner. It should be mentioned that Madaria also attacks animals. Whether horses, goats, chickens, dogs or wolves - there are reports of strange behavior from various animal groups.

Attempts to extract the air from the fog grove to produce the effects of the disease have failed again and again for over 80 years without significant progress.

Visually, the fog grove is characterized by small patches of dry land on which remnants of forests or houses stand. The almost stagnant water masses are partly several meters deep and the cause for these deep cracks in the ground is not known. Water rising from them is usually pleasantly warm, but has a foul odor.

It is also known that countless poor souls have lost their lives over the centuries. They wander through the swamps for a long time until a daring believer gives them the honor to bury them.

Surprisingly, mining does not take place in the Misty Grove, just as there are no inhabited towns in the Misty Grove.

## Villages of the region

Eager chroniclers of Eldria, especially from the principalities of Haag and Ghent, owe us the tradition of the formerly flourishing cities of Old Haag, Eiden and the twin city of Ash-Main-Tahp / Hejning. All three cities were destroyed either by the Istval rockfall or by sectarian forces.

### Old Haag

Old Haag was first mentioned in documents around 950 BC Riga. It was initially a city which clearly developed in the direction of the lively mix of Rah-Kari culture and the typical Eldrian cultural conglomerate along the lines of Ash-Main-Tahp / Hejning. However, the ever short-term treaties of the princes of Eldria increasingly limited the influence of the Rah-Kari from 857 b. Riga. The buildings in the style of the Rah-Kari were still decorated with splendid temples, but they became visibly deserted until the rockfall of Istval around 700 b. Riga flooded the city more and more. in 824 b. Riga the then prince of the city Earlham Thornville issued the decree "Recollection of Values" and thereby legally created the basis for the 2 class society. The Rah-Kari took the short straw and the relationship moved more and more towards the Eldrians.

in 743 b. Riga, after years of swelling tension, the city was rebuilt into a massive fortress, which could never be conquered by the Rah-Kari, as the fortress increasingly disappeared in the newly formed swamps and lost its importance. The continuous death of Alt-Haag found its infamous end in the "red weeks" where followers of a blood god burned the last glorious face of Alt-Haag.

The remains of Alt-Haag are inhabited only by a few dozen inhabitants who do not fall prey to the spirit's addiction and eke out an existence gathering berries and hunting animals and occasionally earning money from stories for brave adventurers or meticulous chroniclers.

### Eiden

Eiden represented the symbol of open-minded Eldrians, who were, however, more than aware of their long culture, and their loathing of elves. Eiden was a city with a thriving lumber industry with some of the finest craftsmanship in the known world. The most famous work of art or building, or tree dwelling, was the Citadel of the Wooden Tighteners - the largest and oldest craft association in Eiden.

![Citadel of the Woodpeckers](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/eidenholzwunder.jpg)

Eiden also distinguished itself with excellent wines, lively rental business and gold prospecting in the Pearl River of that time. The Pearl River also provided the opportunity to ship woodwork and timber as raw material to Eldria at low cost. The foundation of Eiden is impossible to date, because there is no document of Eiden until today. Traditionally, the city boundary has always been drawn by counting everything that was a day's journey from the Rose Tree as Eiden. The Rose Tree, on whose place the barracks of Eiden were built after a lightning strike, was a tree about 70 meters high, which every year in autumn colored its leaves pale pink and then distributed them throughout the city.

Eiden was also flooded by the Istval rockfall around 700 BC Riga and the inhabitants and the craftsmen's guilds gave up trying to build higher and better dams after about 20 years and so the city was left to decay.

### Ash-Main-Tahp / Hejning

Called the Jewel of All Men, Ash-Main-Tahp / Hejning was the most religiously free and also prosperous city on the border of Eldria and Appothis. The city grew peacefully for over 300 years under a triumvirate of priests of Rah-Kari, the royal couple, and the Tower of Scholars - an association of alchemists, explorers, and craftsmen. This triumvirate proved to be almost uncorruptible, and over the decades Ash-Main-Tahp / Hejning became a city on par with the capitals of the great empires in few aspects. Despite a significantly small population, the economic power of Ash-Main-Tahp / Hejning was so great that the Peace of Eldria could be enforced, which shaped the trade relationship throughout Eldria for almost a century and is considered the golden age in Eldria.

Ash-Main-Tahp / Hejning was hit by the Blue Tongue Plague 2 times and it was in this city where the use of the locally widespread Uraninan Flower as a remedy against the Blue Tongue Plague was discovered. Since then, Ash-Main-Tahp / Hejning made high profits from the sale of finished tinctures and was the only known city to afford literacy education for all citizens.

Skillful diplomacy with the Rah-Kari enabled the triumvirate to dispense with a military as far as possible and had only a larger city guard, which was, however, far better equipped than common soldiers.

Finally, however, Ash-Main-Tahp / Hejning was also largely submerged by the Istval rockfall and so some quarters had to be abandoned altogether. These quarters were the quarters of the Rah-Kari which led to a shift of power in the Triumvirate which finally ended the golden years in all of Eldria.

### Infrastructure

The Misty Grove no longer has any infrastructure in the true sense of the word. Some houses and remnants of the 3 major cities of Eldria (Old Haag, Eiden and Ash-Main-Tahp / Hejning) still have well-trodden paths in higher areas where you can walk dry-footed with luck, but many paths are at least ankle-thick covered with water which is infested with so many leeches that you would be blessed if money is invested in good high boots.

Some trails can only be traversed by boats, which in many cases have not been maintained for ages, so money should be invested in craftsmen in addition to boots.

## The history of the region

The Misty Grove used to be the southern foothills of Eldria and represent a natural depression, which used to be overlooked from Eldria's mountain "Raustein" on clear days. There were mixed green forests, rivers rich in fish and several ore mines - especially at the borders to the sky peaks. Livestock, hunting, wood craft and trade with goods of the Rah-Kari and Eldrias played a significant role.

The cities of Eldria were also relatively free, at least in one direction or another.

The Istval Rockfall, the cause of which is widely speculated, initiated the slow decay of the region, and as the people dwindled, so did the importance of the cities, and at some point the region was known to the population only as Misty Grove.

From that point on, the south of Eldria, the Misty Grove became stranger from decade to decade. Stories of people losing their minds known as Madaria, leeches that grew so large that they devoured men whole, and strange creatures that seemed to emerge from the water and disappear just as suddenly. Caravans of Rah-Kari which disappeared without a trace, fog that became so thick that no light was visible and even elves saw only blackness at night added piece by piece the stories about the misty grove which at some point could no longer be clearly separated from reality.

## Economic situation

The economic situation is insignificant. Only a few daring traders with a small entourage traverse the two known, and somewhat passable routes between Appothis, Rintom and Haag. Adventurers, on the other hand, can find valuable remains of the old times in the ruins of the cities, which are then sold at markets in Haag or Rintom.

### The resources of the region

Wood is extracted from the border regions. Here Appothis, Haag and Rintom gain the material for the construction of ballistae, catapults and houses.

Many new species of trees and animals can be found in Nebalhain, and scholars often pay adventurers to bring these unknown species to them.
Nebal Grove is also home to various monsters, and many craftsmen and alchemists pay a lot of money for monster materials from this region.

Finally, Misty Grove is also a treasure trove of lost cities and relics, and many travel to Misty Grove to rob these cities of their lost relics and riches - though most of these fortune seekers never return home.

## Sociopolitical Situation

Legally, before the Fall, each region was self-sufficient. Since the Fall of Istval, both the Rah-Kari Empire and, more recently, the Empire have laid claim to the Misty Grove, but no power has succeeded in establishing border posts or even cities there, making ide claims dead law in a dead region.


## Climatic conditions

Since the rockfall, mild-temperate conditions have been replaced by mostly cool-humid permanent conditions. Occasionally parts of the fog grove near the sky tops freeze over superficially, but the vast majority remains constantly cool and damp. The fog is usually so dense that the sun can only be glimpsed, on many days it is not visible at all, and at night it is so dense that not even elves can see anything.

### The flora and fauna

#### Monsters in the region

##### Common Moss Mound {.unnumbered}

Among the perhaps most harmless monsters are Common Mosshills. They are characterized by a restless disposition and often follow lonely hikers through the misty grove, saving them from drowning. Why exactly the Common Mosshill does this is unclear, possibly the monster mistakes the human for a big fish, but then lets go of him at the screaming humans. In general, mosshills can be easily scared away by shouting loudly. Mosshills only pose a threat when the males are looking for mates. This is noticeable by the smell of sulfur and the bright yellow colored backs of the animals. Moss hills can be easily overpowered by a handful of armed mercenaries. Only single fighters should beware of them.

They occur in the fringes of the misty forest and are usually the omen for lumberjacks and fishermen to turn back in order not to penetrate too deep into the misty grove. ![Common Moss Hill](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/fog grove monster.jpg)

In the real sense, every citizen knows awakened. Revenants, which were not allowed to return to the eternal realms and thus already brought death to countless wanderers and adventurers. It is recommended to surround the camps with fences at night - usually strings stretched at different heights are enough to keep the revenants away. Here it should be noted to be as quiet as possible, otherwise far more of these awakened are attracted and you then quickly find yourself in dicey situations.

#### The Skinner of Eiden

Probably more in the realm of legends is the Skinner of Eiden. Formerly named after the Skinner of Eiden, it is said to be a monstrosity created by the Tower of Scholars to possess enough muscle power to build the dams higher. However, this pretension could never be confirmed. Thus, it is necessary to avoid the buildings of the Tower of the Learned, because safe is safe.

## Rumors of the region

### Harvester of Souls

The story of the Harvester of Souls has been circulating in the taverns of the border towns of Eldiras, Haag, and Rintom for several decades.

According to the story, the Harvester of Souls, resembling a human in shape, collects the souls of people wandering in the Misty Grove. The knights of fortune, who travel the Misty Grove in search of old treasures or new paths, are visited by the Harvester of Souls on the third night, when they wander around lost. The Harvester of Souls usually comes to the lost ones at the darkest hour of the night with a shimmering scythe in one hand and a shining book in the other and offers them a way out of the labyrinth of streams, ponds, bogs and swamps of the Misty Grove. All they have to do is write their worst deeds in the book or reveal their deeds on their knees before the figure.

Then the Harvester of Souls offers to take them back to the place of their birth to leave their own soul or that of another human to him as pay. If the lost person gives his own soul, he goes free. If, on the other hand, the soul of another is sacrificed, the Harvester of Souls takes the soul of the aforementioned and cuts off the head of the lost person, whereupon the headless, lost poor soldier of fortune must roam the Misty Grove forever as an Awakened.

What exactly the story is based on, or whether this figure actually exists, cannot be said beyond doubt. On the one hand, this legend is classic for all kinds of religions that preach selflessness, on the other hand, a handful of these blessings already reported, although sworn to know nothing of the story.

### The Drudarn Clan

A plague originating from the lands south of Misty Grove was transported to the swamps. This disease had a high mortality rate and killed many creatures, animals, and Animali who came into contact with it. An Animali clan called Drudarn found that one of its members was immune due to its mutation.
After experimenting with the specific mutation that came from one of the local insects, they began to have other Animali defeat the insect and use it for their own mutation. After many generations, this clan is now known to have the mutation of the insect that makes them immune to the disease.

The disease itself affects the lungs of the sick person. This means that the creature slowly loses its lung capacity until eventually it cannot breathe at all.

The disease is still very common in the territory of the Drudarn clan, causing other clans to keep their distance.

### The Black Feather Gang
Many say that Misty Grove is hell incarnate, as it harbors countless diseases and monstrosities unknown to humans. For this reason, people spread rumors about this region like wildfire.
One such rumor is that of the terrible Knights of Misty Haim: people believe that there is a group of demonic black knights that roam the swamps of Misty Haim. Travelers claim they are the Knights of Eldria, who were sent out when Misty Grove was created and died. Others believe that they are the manifestation of the swamp and that they exist only to kill the people who dare to enter the Misty Grove. However, one traveler who was lucky enough to see these knights and survived said that he could remember the symbol on the knights' armor, and he claimed that it belonged to the Band of Blackfeather, a band of knights who roamed Eiden before it was destroyed.

### The Groaning Tree
Several travelers and merchants who passed through Misty Grove tell stories of the same incident. They all report that during their travels they suddenly heard a person moaning in the distance. Sometimes it was a man, sometimes a woman, and sometimes a child. The travelers almost always sent someone out to investigate the sound, but no one ever returned. Some travelers tried to avoid the direction the sound was coming from, but in some cases the sounds came closer in time.
Travelers could hear the moaning for days until they finally left the swamp. It is said that most people were driven mad by the sounds they heard in Misty Haim, and that many still have fears from their time there. Some people say that hearing the sounds is almost a death sentence, and that it is best to run back to where you came from as quickly as possible.
However, a traveler named Thomas Jeckmann was able to see where the sounds were coming from and survived. He tells of a story in which his caravan was traveling through Nebelhaim when they suddenly heard a man moaning. A few guards went to investigate, but did not return. After an hour, Jeckmann investigated the situation himself, and when he finally arrived at the source of the sound, he saw one of his comrades impaled with wooden spikes. In shock, he fell over and hit the ground face down. When he looked up again, he could finally see what had caused the noise. It was a huge tree with the face of a demon that had lured him and his men. Jeckmann ran as fast as he could, and miraculously survived. To this day, no other person has been able to confirm his story, but whenever travelers in Nebelhaim hear groans, they immediately know they are in great danger.
