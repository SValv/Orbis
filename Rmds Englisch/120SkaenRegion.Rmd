"On the skaen you are free. Live where and how you want. Unfortunately, death sees it the same way there."

The Ska'en are located in the North Sea off the coast of the Empire. The islands are surrounded by the northern sea. Thus, the temperatures are theoretically mild, as waters have a balancing effect on the temperature fluctuations, but in the case of the Ska'en this means.
The storms stay for a long time. The weather is always cold. The mood of the population is constantly explosive.

The Ska'en itself used to be much more heavily forested, until the Sea Peoples began to use the slow-growing wood there for ships.  The very largest part of the island was thus cleared. Thus the reasons to visit the island were lost. Since only fresh water was available, but this was made up for with frost bites, storms and the aggressive strangely-becoming-remainers, the importance of the Ska'en was lost.
The fish that is abundant around the Ska'en can be caught without landing.
As a result, the inhabitants fought for the last remaining wooden orchards or retreated into the narrow old artificial and natural caves of the Ska'en.

Due to the limited and sparsely distributed resources, no higher culture could be developed after the departure of the sea people. Local warlords, who could be overwhelmed by what felt like 4 Fre'danes, fought each other and made and broke treaties.
While this is quite common among other cultures, such as the orcs or the inhabitants of Eldria. However, the frequency of contract breaking is already so special, that here one from week to week partly new conflicts break out. In the process, minimal resources are at stake.  A dozen burned skins are enough to kidnap the daughters of the others.

As a result, there are no reliable records from chroniclers about the state of the Ska'en during all the centuries when the empire flourished and the Rah Kari empire shone and the Eldrians built up centuries-old dynasties.
The Empire attempted to establish a base in 124 A.D. Riga with a fleet primarily tasked with mapping the waters north of the Ska'en. This was the first official contact.
Ungraced sailors of the Empire are nearly all sailors under the Emperor's flag, and so they were temporarily stranded on the Ska'en when an iceberg damaged several ships and the storm then shredded the sails at night.  Forced to land, they built a small settlement. They explored the area and, by rebuilding the ships, were able to reestablish contact with Storm Cape, the Empire's naval base, with at least two small ships carrying wounded and word of salvage and materialistic support.

The second fleet of ships was much better equipped and sailed back to the Ska'en some 4 months later when the winter storms subsided.  But time did not stand still for the survivors on the island. The base was overrun. Most of the men starved to death or were murdered by the local population.
This second fleet of ships was also again stopped by icebergs and sank a few kilometers off the coast. The survivors took the rowboats and made it ashore. Presumably, they met the same fate as the first expedition.
After the personal intervention of the Emperor, where he could no longer justify the lack of sailors, the money for the naval fleet was cut and the Ska'en were declared "unsettleable, worthless". The third fleet, was poorly equipped and financed by a small group of wealthy dwarves and launched in the summer.
This small fleet actually managed to land. However, after a year and 80% losses, it left again. The indigenous population gradually decimated the new settlers in the pitch black nights.

The reports about the Ska'en thus come from few sources. On the one hand, there are more rumors and legends of the sea people about the "free islands" where the water is clear, the forest is peaceful and the women are free-spirited, while all the men hide in caves.

More reliable are the dwarven reports on which the following passages are based:

Natives are clearly human race.
Probably descended from the Sea People. Language is a mixture of Rahkari and Imperial.
Small areas of forest still available. Managed by local warlords.
Main food is underground mushrooms and fish. Agriculture is possible in the southernmost areas during the short summer months. Not productive.
There are no unified guilds.
The three islands have changing rulers, no unified writing system.

The winter and autumn months are spent in the ruined cities. The heating material is a pungent smelling oil, which is transported by a huge ship, which some worship as "the deity".
In all likelihood, it could be a ship of state. Possibly the Sirkali. However, this could not be confirmed exactly by the reports of the local population.
This ship of state delivers oil via sea monsters which are collected annually west of the Ska'en and then exchanged for new human lives on the Ska'en.

The energy source, the ec reaches pungent and causes watery eyes and coughing when lit indoors.  Food roasted over such fires tastes disgusting and is unlikely to be edible.

The poorest segment of the population are uniformly referred to by the local as "mole people."  These cannot afford to live in the few intact houses. These mole people, they are normal people, heat with the poisonous oil. As a result, their throat turns black and over time they go blind and get pitch black eyes. Their voice becomes extremely rough. Rougher than sailor voices is the rule here. Life expectancy is probably greatly reduced. These "mole men" occasionally mine and use heat blast mining and may occasionally unearth coal or ores.

There is no single jurisdiction, power, or recognized currency. Claims to power change very frequently and usually lead to bloody skirmishes.  People who come to the Sk'aen Islands are often given the choice of which warlord to choose, or which profession to pursue. The choice of profession is very limited, however, and amounts to fisherman, warrior, miner (future mole man), or wood scavenger or "chosen one". The latter will probably be sold to the ship of state as slaves, but until then, provided you accept the brand and do not carry weapons, you can move freely around the islands.

The hierarchies are thus generally flat, and the mole-men can usually move easily from meaningless miner life on one island to meaningless miner life on another. Only the warriors have something like loyalty.  These warriors enjoy a moderately pleasant but short life until they are stabbed to death.
There is no concept of marriage. Co-opulation is with whom and where and how you want.
The few uniform things on the Ska'en are the respect of children until they are 15 years old and the disrespect of the mole people. The children are marked each winter with another tattoo on their necks. On the one hand the age is determined in this way, on the other hand it can be clearly distinguished whether someone is native here or has decided to let his miserable life on the miserable Ska'en go to waste.
Faith in the narrower sense does not exist. Gods, if they are not ships, are primarily worshipped to pray for the death of most of the others in order to get more resources. People do this not because they hate other people because of their skin color or religion or caste, but because they realize every day that there are simply not enough resources for everyone.
In this respect, revenge is not waged because of "insult to honor", but because of the murder of the closest family members, i.e. partners, or because of the destruction of property. Which is actually a good achievement. This actually still comes closest to the all-money.

The source of the oil:
Animals called oil swimmers, which generally live peacefully, and like many sea creatures are streamlined, grow to between 20 and 40 meters long when fully grown.  They mate annually west of the Ska'en. This also attracts natural predators, which attack smaller boats of people in addition to the oil swimmers. This makes it extremely dangerous for smaller vessels to capture oil swimmers. However, carcasses of oil swimmers can be more easily taken at the end of the mating season.  However, the newly adult oil swimmers, which are just mating for the first time, can be caught even by the weak ships of the Skaen inhabitants.

According to reports, the Sirkali, in this mating season during the winter storms, hunt the oil swimmers most successfully in order to subsequently get cheap sailors on the Skaen.



* Oil as an energy source, poisonous when burned, leads to blindness, black skin and rough voice/black mouth
* Basically settled by the sea people for the wood, which was very quickly cleared away and collapse of society/people. After that no more interest from the sea people
* Incursion of the empire which came only to the southern islands. 3 waves - first badly prepared, second storm, third landed and died quickly
* isolation of hierarchical nations as they do not want free ideas to spill over
* Mishmash of mini-factions that fuck each other non-stop
* Great dependency on the Sirkali - landed every few months, resulting in fights between all sorts of local powerhouses
* lack of wood, a lot of fissch
* relatively widespread blood cult culture


Whales:
* oil prey a kind of whales - 20-40m adult, produce the oil
* mate 1x a year in always the same places - all go hunting (monsters/seafaring/skaenleut - free for all)
* whales like to be hunted by certain monsters
* humans hunt mainly young animals, because they get them on boats, bigger ships also manage adult animals
