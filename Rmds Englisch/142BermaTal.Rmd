The Berma Valley is that valley which lies southeast of the haze peaks.
It is separated from the rest of the civilized world by the Misty Grove, the Misty Peaks and the deserts of Appothis.
But if you cross the mysterious Misty Peaks or the endless deserts of Appothis, you won't end up in paradise - as you might expect from the landscape - but in the dangerous Berma Valley.

Many regions of the known world are dangerous and full of mystery, but few come close to the region of the Berma Valley.
Most people know that the Rah Kari desert can be unforgiving to the traveler, but the traveler who comes to the Berma Valley unprepared will meet a more gruesome death.
Little is known about this region, as almost all expeditions that ventured into the region were never seen again.
The few who have returned have described the region as a war-torn area populated by savages.
Savages who mercilessly slaughter each other and sacrifice their children to blasphemous unknown gods.
Even the forest seems to hate newcomers, and so, according to soldiers' tales, it rises at night to crush the civilized into nature.

Despite the cruelty of these people, there are several tribes in the region, which differ fundamentally in what animal, monster, or other monstrosity is currently worshipped by the savages of the tribe.
Although there are countless smaller and medium sized tribes, there are 3 tribes that dominate the Berma Valley: Ulugda, Rola-Akthir, and Vogalta.


The Berma Valley is also described as the Valley of Monsters.
The few travelers who have been there and still live to tell stories about the Berma Valley describe the region as full of monsters and monstrosities - which themselves are grotesquely disfigured or mutated.
According to stories, the Berma Valley even houses people who have become monsters.

## Tribes

Travelers claim that the tribes living in the Berma Valley worship a single monster or monster species in their territory.
Tribesmen go far beyond prayers, dedications, and customary worship to satisfy their gods.
Through dark rituals, some are even able to obtain the traits of their monster gods themselves - which is said to be the ultimate grace of these gods.

These characteristics are - according to reports of Sir Eduard von Haag - always different in the observed tribes.
They depend on which idols or abominations are worshipped as gods by the particular tribe.
For example, such a change may result in a single hand being formed into a kind of claw, or the growth of wings and the consequent ability to fly.
This ensures that tribe A can defend themselves against tribe B very easily - as their physical change through the ritual of giving flesh causes a strengthened skin.
Because of the diversity, it is assumed, it is impossible for one tribe to take absolute rule over the Berma Valley.

## The gift of flesh

The gift of flesh, which can be considered one of the most terrifying rituals in the Berma Valley, is the "tradition" through which the tribes come closest to their gods, demons and monsters and gradually take on the characteristics and traits of a monster.

In the ritual of giving flesh, the bravest or most promising youths are selected for fusion into a "Gro'flaak warrior."
Then, using body parts of monsters and unknown substances, the chosen are fused into grotesque mixtures of man and beast.
These Gro'flaak warriors often form the elite soldiers of a tribe.

The fusion is considered a great honor among the tribesmen, as the new "beings" are considered protectors of the tribe.
However, although the tribes of the Berma Valley consider this fusion a great honor, people from the civilized world have observed that these fused beings suffer great and permanent pain and anguish.
For example, they constantly writhe during sleep or engage in self-injurious behavior.
Also, Gro'flaak warriors seem to be mostly of bad temper, as they are more often in quarrels and brawls with other tribe members.
Likewise, gaping wounds are often seen on monster people and the wailing of newly created Gro'flaak warriors can often be heard at night.
Less aggressively minded tribes admit that serving as a Gro'flaak warrior for the tribe is a painful burden, but nothing like walking around all day on a horse or in heavy armor.
Gro'flaak warriors do acknowledge that pain is there, but also that it is not perceived as bad after a while.

These altered Kireger still resemble humans, but it is much the same as with Awakened.
They were or are humans, but you are "alien".
In the first 10-15 years, these "beings" retain some aspects of their humanity and are used as human weapons against the other tribes or non-worshipped monsters - in a role similar to the heavy infantry from Eldria.
They are trained warriors, excellent in combat and loyal to their tribe.
For their own "luck", most Gro'flaak warriors are killed in battle against other tribes or monsters a few years after their transformation.
Those poor seals who survive the frequent tribal conflicts, however, lose their minds completely due to the constant pain they have to endure.

It is believed that the physical suffering only gets worse with time.
Also, as time goes by, the unchanged tribe members act more and more reserved towards them as they become less and less human.
The lack of affection - the "strangeness" in these warriors - which not even a mother can overlook, is an additional burden here.
Although these warriors are always celebrated for their heroic deeds, without including the hero himself in the celebration.

Not surprisingly, most of these beings - intentionally or unintentionally - leave their tribe and move into the wilderness to live the rest of their lives as solitary nomads.
In the process, they degenerate more and more into monsters that kill everything and everyone they come across.
Unsurprisingly, in some tribes it is the duty of every "fused" to engage in a last stand against real monsters or other tribes at the first sign of reality loss or insanity and attack them until the tribe or monsters are wiped off the face of the earth.

## The tribes of the region

There are a myriad of tribes in the Berma Valley - some are newly founded, others disband or are swallowed by larger tribes.
Most tribes are too small to be of great importance, though some consist of several settlements and many hundreds of members.
There are, however, three dominant tribes whose membership numbers are in the thousands.
All three have large spheres of influence and many settlements and wield immense power.
They have affiliated tribes, some of which fight proxy wars among themselves or try in their own way to secure an advantage in the difficult political situation.
These three tribes are the Ulugda - often called the brown ones, the Vogalta and the red Rola-Akthir.

### Ulugda

Heb Eorri provided the most complete accounts to date of the Ulugda tribe, to which the following description refers.
The Ulugda tribe inhabits the eastern slopes of the haze peaks which point into the Berma Valley.
According to the observations of the Rahkariforschian Heb Eorri, no significant buildings of the Ulugda are known.
It seems that the Ulugda live in cave systems, which are decorated with pictures of a giant worm at the entrances.
According to the reports of Heb Eorri, screams and chants in an unknown language can be heard from the caves, if one dares to approach them up to a few meters.
The assumption is that it is the local tribal language.
The most daring Rahkari of the expedition team ventured into the caves, but were murdered in the caves.
The next day, however, the head of a scout - impaled on a spear - was found at the cave entrance.

The Rahkari were also able to take 5 prisoners.
Their anatomy was normal throughout, except for various scars on their bodies.
These scars could serve the function of skin paintings, however, this cannot be confirmed.
More remarkable is that all 5 prisoners died after 2 days in captivity by suicide at night with poison.

What exactly the Ulugda worship is difficult to describe.
Beside the paintings at the cave entrances, similar drawings on the lower back of all 5 prisoners could be proved.
Whether this is a worm, a snake or a crude lindworm cannot be said with certainty.
However, the drawings suggest that this worm-like creature has scales that can be used by humans.
The same "scales" were found on the clothes of the prisoners, which suggests that it could be a snake.

### Rola-Akthir

The Northern tribe - called Rola-Akthir by the locals - is perhaps the most powerful tribe in the Berma Valley.
It is believed that the first people to arrive in the Berma Valley settled in the northern part of the region - where the Rola-Akthir tribe still lives today.
If this is true, it also makes the Rola-Akthir the oldest tribe in the Berma Valley.

The name "Rola-Akthir" - which means "bloodthirsty" in Rahkari - was given to the tribe by the well-known explorer and discoverer Heb Eorr. Their settlement can be recognized by a pitch-black boulder dozens of meters high, almost like a ritual tower, located in the center of the settlement. According to Heb Eorri, this tribe is the most "ceremonial" in the Berma Valley and has a lot of its own rites and ceremonies that strongly influence the daily life of the Rola-Akthir. One of these rites seems to be the hunting of intentionally released captives. In this process, the prisoners are usually given a few hours "head start" completely naked. Thereupon, the warriors who have been changed by the gift of flesh, as well as the normal warriors, begin the hunt. The human hunt ends with the hunt of the escaped where their still writhing bodies are laid to that pitch-black boulder in the middle of the settlement. Afterwards, all the hunters involved prepare themselves a feast, where they paint or dress themselves in red, since red is the color of the Rola.Akthir.

The warriors of this tribe, changed by the gift of meat, show strong changes.
For example, a kind of insect eye grows on the back of the bald head.
The original arms remain unchanged, but two more are added under the shoulders, which look as if they are growing out of the chest and are not sewn on crudely.
These arms end in blades that strongly resemble the claws of large beetles.
Red lines are often painted all over their bodies.

The Rola-Akthir are one of the most aggressive tribes in the Berma Valley and many tribes are afraid of the red warriors.
They are known to organize their best Gro'flaak warriors into a group called the Ar'Tin, where they teach and encourage each other.
Meeting the Ar'Tin is one of the safest and fastest ways to die in the Berma Valley.

### Vogalta

The first tribe an explorer is most likely to encounter is the Vogalta tribe, which is located in the south of Berma Valley and is often found in the haze peaks.
This tribe is known to be very territorial.
If anyone dares to enter the tribe's land, the intruder is quickly hunted down, often without warning.
Alternatively, the curious person meets his or her abrupt end from ambush when a tribe member suddenly jumps out of the bushes or drops from the trees.

The Vogalta have the most developed settlement to date and also incorporate the region's large trees - which are said to look like knotty and twisting pines - into their settlement.
The tribe is also known to practice brewing potions or drugs by all members.
However, this often leaves them short on ingredients to make something that can rival the potions of other civilizations.
The Vogalta tribe worships an abomination that can be described as a giant forest snake.
The scholars of Lord Charles of Austen's expedition, circa 345 before Riga even claim to have seen this serpent preparing paths for the Vogalta through the forest and mountains.

> I was pissing over the cliff at the haze peaks and then I saw such a huge thing in the distance.
> Green, snake-like it broke trees apart, behind it bipedal creatures, should be humans or orcs.
> If I hadn't been pissing I would have pissed myself.
> The green thing was easily 50 meters long.
>
> - John Edingson, soldier of Lord Charles of Austen, 345 B.C.

Scouts of the tribe who could be killed or captured occasionally had snake-like, scaled skin.
These oddities - probably also created by the ritual of giving flesh - could bend their bodies in inhuman ways.
They would often hide in the trees, where their green-brown skin made them hard to see, and wait until foreign troops were directly below them.
Then they jumped down, grabbed their opponents, held them like a strangler snake and bit into the head or shoulders of the soldiers.
However, thanks to their helmets and armor, it was difficult for them to make deadly bites.

> "However, to set these "creatures" on fire was an impossibility. I had good men, skillfully trained on the blade, healers, archers. All were horrified and amazed at what this "thing" could be. Not even the corpses burned. Then at night they came again. Pitch black new moon nights, yet they found us and attacked as if they could see. We survived with only a few casualties, but after a few weeks morale was already so low among the men that a deeper expedition into the foggy Berma Valley seemed impossible."
>
> - Lord Charles of Austen, 345 B.R.

## Infrastructure

The region of the Bermata Valley has no real infrastructure, in the form of paved roads or river trade routes.
There are primitive paths through the forests and simple wooden buildings within the settlements of the individual tribes, but none of the tribes is really connected to the others by secured paths on which wagons could be pulled by horses.
The source of this shabby infrastructure, as far as Heb Eorri is concerned, is the fact that the tribes are constantly at war with each other.
The only known tribe that has roads paved with stones is the "Vogalta" tribe.
These roads lead to ritual places or the largest of their subjugated tribes.
Supposedly, these roads were driven through the forest by a giant snake.
Then, the gravel layer just below the surface was exposed by removing the earth and the destroyed woody vegetation.
Although this would in principle allow transport by wagon, this has not been observed in the Berma Valley to date.

## The history of the region

The history of the Berma Valley consists of a long collection of stories, black jokes and legends told by various people, some of them drunk.
The Berma Valley was once a probably uninhabited region, where an endless number of monsters roamed, which is why it was hardly populated.

> " Everybody knows the stories about the Misty Grove. Empty swampy area, air that makes you go crazy and on top of that monsters and an endless number of awakened people. Well, the Berma Valley is very similar in inhospitability for strangers. For the natives, however, it seems to be a paradise. Everywhere grows something to eat, warriors who could even tear constructs apart are on the side of the tribe. But then these monsters everywhere. I don't know how the first people could settle there in the past. Either they were all crazy, outcasts or the devil himself led them there as punishment. But, be that as it may. For strangers, the Berma Valley has lost little of its original vestibule-to-hell character."
>
> - Heb Eorri, about the life endings in the original Berma Valley

Most stories say that the Berma Valley is the region from which the monsters of our world originally came, but this is notoriously difficult to prove.
Chroniclers confirm that many monsters have always been sighted at the edges of the Misty Peaks, but the same is still said today about the Misty Grove or the Sky Peak Mountains.
However, since monsters are difficult to map, even today, the Bermuda Valley monster cradle hypothesis remains exactly what it is: an untested hypothesis.

### The Zamrak Warriors and the Berma Valley {#Zamrak Warriors}

The most widely held belief about the current human inhabitants of Berma Valley is that these people once belonged to an organization that hunted monsters.
They called themselves the "Zamrak Warriors" or "Warriors of Zamrak" . These warriors are a community of people who have been known for hundreds of years to hunt monsters - especially those who dare to terrorize the common people.

The first records of the Zamrak warriors are kept by the Church of Darcy, during the age when organized monster hunting was commonplace in Eldria for young and old.
At that time, it was common for many untrained warriors and peasants to band together to hunt monsters.
This "mass instead of class" strategy was effective in reducing the number of monsters, but not so much when you had to manage an empire in which a large number of peasants suddenly took up arms and organized themselves, and many of them died in the monster hunt.

Since the sheer number of humans does not always seem to be superior to the brute strength of demons and abominations, a better trained group was needed.
The Zamrak warriors were "born".
And their methods - the exchange of knowledge, the customization of weapons, the explicit study of monsters over generations - produced remarkable results.
Not only did Eldria become significantly safer as a result, but the Zamrak warriors themselves were needed less and less.
After all, who needed monster hunters when there were no more monsters?

The Zamrak warriors, also due to a lack of political interest, let a large part of their "friendships" with princes, lords and priests go to waste.
The contact between the highborn and the warriors became less.
Like friends who do not see each other for years, a certain skepticism forms on the part of the lords and priests, despite their lavish past.

The sworn goal of the Zamrak warriors to rid the world of abominations, and the lack of venality, frightened high religious representatives and lordships.
Resentment was more often deliberately scattered.
The Zamrak warriors did not care, as their goal was never to influence politics.
The principalities, on the other hand, influenced what they could influence, grew, thanks to the more controllable environmental conditions, and became stronger and stronger.
Soon the lords in their principalities did not want monster hunters that were not under their control.
Especially if they were armed, organized and numerous.

Initially still clearly militarily inferior to the united Zamrak warriors, the stable conditions caused by the monster shortage eventually led to militarily strong principalities and to the Zamrak warriors being denied food, lodging, payment or dignity.
Scared off and ostracized as warriors fighting unicorns, the Zamrak warriors had no choice but to look for a new place.

Thereupon, these warriors went to the Haze Peaks to look down contemptuously on the highborn in Eldria and return at dawn - when the abominations tyrannize humans again - to save humanity, as their oath demanded.
So much for the legend.

During this "Time of Removal," a commander named Emeric Tholy led the warriors.
Tholy promised the warriors that if they followed him through the deserts and past the mountain ranges of the Haze Peaks, they would find a new, promising land.
Tholy was an excellent warrior and leader.
Too good for some.
This gave rise to rumors that Tholy was either possessed or insane.
Alternatively, it is described that Tholy never showed his face, because people should not make an image of him.
This gave rise to the rumor that Emeric Tholy actually represented three different people.
However, this cannot be proven beyond doubt from the traditions.

However, a clear transition over these warriors in the haze peaks or behind the haze peaks to the tribal structures of the Bermatal cannot be proven.

Nowadays, the inqusition assessment is that Tholy was ruled by Ciresh, the blood goddess of treachery and illusions. She is said to have deliberately led Tholy and the rest of the warriors of Zamrak to this region.

Some Inquisitors believe that Ciresh made a pact with the Blood Goddess Ga'ar to take the Zamrak warriors from Eldria and bring them to the Berma Valley. There she was to make the warriors her puppets. It is unknown what Ga'ar promised Ciresh for this action. Some representatives speculate that Ciresh was promised free reign over Eldria to torture her victims in her sadistic way without being disturbed by other blood gods.
Another theory is that Ga'ar promised Ciresh a cooperation in which she would act against the blood god Hartemus.
This is difficult to prove, however, as the statements are based on the transcripts of a former High Inquisitor who was deemed insane and shortly thereafter exected by the Inquisition itself.

Ciresh - so the forbidden the transcript called "The Pact and Devils" - however did not keep their promise to hand over the warriors to Ga'ar.
As a mockery, the Zamrak warriors were supposed to "worship" various monsters, and as a gloat for the rotten influence Ga'ar has on people, they were also supposed to merge with these monsters.

It is not known how much influence Ciresh has on the tribesmen of Berma Valley today, but the tribes all worship their own monster gods today.
Some people believe that Ciresh did this out of spite towards Ga'ar, or simply because it is in their nature.

The tribes of the former Zamrak warriors can now be found throughout the Berma Valley, though this legacy is long forgotten.
The name of the organization has also been discarded, or at least no tribes that called themselves Zamrak have been found.

This, however, makes the record of the exectuted High Inquistor difficult to verify, according to unanimous scholarly opinion.
The only evidence is that each tribe is out to subjugate or massacre other tribes.
Only to their own tribe the inhabitants of the Bermatal have a fanatical loyalty, with which also lasting paralells already end.

## Economic situation

There is no regular economy in Bermata Valley, because tribes hardly want to cooperate or trade with each other.
Each tribe generally produces its own goods.
If an item is stolen from another tribe, the tribesmen either fight over it or it is given to the tribal leaders as tribute.
What happens to the item after that is up to the leader.
In the case of more valuable objects, however, the respective main tribes of the Ulugda, Rola-Akthir or the Vogalta interfere and determine what is right - might makes right even in the Berma Valley.
Consequently, no trade between the Berma Valley and external powers - such as Eldria or the Rah Kari - is documented.

### The resources of the region

The most common resources in the Berma Valley are undoubtedly monster materials and a natural very abundant supply of food in the form of fruits and plants.
Monsters are found throughout the region, and although each tribe worships a particular monster, other "species" of monsters are hunted to obtain materials for weapons, clothing, or general items.
The meat is often consumed, the tribes believe, to obtain the strength of the other monsters.
Many of the "special" goods that the tribes make themselves are made from monster parts.
Drinking cups, bows, battle drugs, and armor all find their origins in the innards, sinews, bones, and skins from the Scheusals of this world.
Because of the naturally abundant supply of food, each tribe has a large supply of just that.
Since large monsters are killed just as often, large quantities of meat often accumulate, which the tribe members eat a little later.
This makes the tribes not unlike the orc tribes of the rest of the known world in this respect.
Each tribe usually has a gathering place where the food found in the tribal area is stored and prepared to prevent decay from fungus and rot.

Wood itself is the main building material used by the tribes.
Due to the dense forest, low human density, there is no shortage of excellent lumber.
The Berma idiots, the derogatory name for inhabitants of the valley given to the people there by the dwarf Vrak of the Realms, do not erect large buildings and rarely build new ones, so they will probably never run out of wood.
It would be certainly within the possibilities to build larger houses, but probably simply lacks the will for it - after all, there is enough food and protection by the Gro'flaak warriors.

The tribes have no more complex objects or utensils such as constructs, wagons, bells, churches, navigational aids, or parchment.
Whether this is due to limited intellect, war, or other reasons cannot be determined.
The only unanimous opinion is that it is good that these "savages" do not set foot in the lands of Eldria or the Rahkari, nor are they interested in other goods that have been delivered.

> "These people are suspicious to me. Please, who would voluntarily turn down a kilogram of gold just to get a special warrior? Who would give up formidable rahkari liquor at unbeatable prices? Who wouldn't want to buy slaves? Please, Rahkar slave girls with full hair and bosoms let even orcs forget theirs. There was also no interest to hear my stories. Only the potions I carried aroused their interest, which they stole from me under threat of violence. But 30,000 reiks of potions is no reason for me to risk my life. And to have these people slaughtered by my orc battalion would not be in keeping with my wealth. Gems, glittering things, steel armor, nothing but drugs enthralled these savages. No wonder you can't get out of this green dunghill of a valley. The Empire will pay its debt before these savages are considered civilized, so primitive are they."

## Sociopolitical situation

In general, apart from the three dominant tribes, there are no political intrigues worth mentioning.
The various tribes of people control the land, which is not ruled by monstrosities themselves.
However, none of the three major known clans of Vogolta, Rola-Akthir or Ugalda seems to be able to bring the other to its knees without being annihilated by other tribes, or roving groups of monsters.
This stalemate has probably existed for hundreds of years, as the descriptions of the few expeditions to the fringes of the Bermata Valley have for centuries told of the impossibility of forging alliances, or even of persuading tribes to act against their tribal leadership, or at least against the dominant tribes.

## Climatic conditions

Although the Berma Valley enjoys a warm climate characterized by dense forest and ample rainfall, the temperatures in the region, combined with the high humidity, can often become uncomfortable for heavily equipped warriors.
However, the high humidity and temperature do not seem to bother the human "natives" of the Bermata Valley much.
Due to the lack of extreme temperatures, building shelters also seems to be less of a necessity.
than it is, for example, in the cold areas of Nor.
Not surprisingly for the attentive reader of these transcripts, the climate rarely changes drastically during the year and the region almost always remains warm and humid.

### The flora and fauna

#### Monsters in the region

As the supposed birthplace of monsters, the Berma Valley is considered the home of the blood goddess Ga'ar.
Some travelers believe that every monster once migrated from this place to the other regions of the world.
An indescribable number and diversity of monsters roam the region, some of these oddities of nature seeming to have no even remotely similar cousins in the rest of the world.
Several individual sightings always result in creepy stories for the later children of the travelers, but it does not allow to date to conclude the life characteristics of the monsters.

Regardless of the civilized scholars of the Empire, the Rahkari or Eldrias, the elves came to a similar conclusion in ancient legends that the Berma Valley can be seen as the cradle of the monsters of the known world.
For example, the elven caste of the Paws from the tribes of Silva Nacia, that is, the caste of the animal breeders of the elves, sees the roots of some monsters behind the haze peaks.
Also, lore describes that the elves, as well as their faithful spiders, used to fight together alongside humans against these abominations, though there are no records of this in Eldria.
The common usage describes - and this is one of the few things that the civilized peoples agree on - that the Berma Valley can be described as the vestibule of Hell.
The place where monsters are born and flung into the world like diseases.
The place where people become monsters figuratively and literally.

The comparison can be imagined as follows.
The people in the poor quarters in the cities can rarely afford healers.
Thus all kinds of diseases arise.
These can spread from the poor quarters to the higher classes.
However, since the adjacent artisan districts are the first to be infected by the overflowing diseases, and artisans can already afford healers in some cases, fewer diseases will be found here.
In the quarters of the rich and powerful, the best healers will constantly be guests and thus also significantly fewer diseases.
Just as the Berma Valley seems to be the poor quarter of this world, the Haze Peaks are the artisan quarters and the realms of Eldria are the rich quarters.
This would explain a certain frequency of monsters, healers, in this case warriors who eradicate the monsters from the face of the earth, become more frequent the further one moves away from the Berma Valley.
However, since neither nobles are immune to all diseases, some monsters and abominations are still found even in the civilized realms of humans.

## Legends of the region

### The hatred of civilization

As already described, the motivation to trade of the people from the Berma Valley is extremely low.
For the natives of the Berma Valley, the reason seems to be that the arrogance of the people with their fortresses and the exclusion of nature only leads to nature fighting back.
Several tribes report that at the end of the time of equality with nature, a tribe will appear that will worship a giant fire-breathing lizard.
This lizard-worshipping tribe will then be kissed by this same lizard.
Thereupon their bodies turn into embers.
These embers will then burn down all those in the Berma Valley who are not of pure heart for their own and for nature.
According to Selibg legend, the fire-breathing lizard had already burned the first humans and with the ember bodies of its tribe burned the first humans and any trace of civilization out of the Berma Valley.
Since then, the lizard has been waiting in ambush, always with its eyes on the Berma Valley, ready to burn anyone who goes against nature or rises above it.

### Vrak of the Realms

The dwarf who traveled the Bermata Valley the longest was Vrak the Rich, who is said to have carried hundreds of pounds of gold with him.
Before his journey to the Bermatal, he had bought an entire tribe of orcs, telling them that they could become gods themselves and break the cycle of being eaten and recreated if they cleansed the cradle of the gods, the Bermatal, of monsters. He would be their guiding hand, only you had to follow him.

Along with nearly a thousand orc warriors and about 150 people, he set out for the Berma Valley in 211. There he built the fortress "Goldblick" the mine "Des Kaiser's Tasche" and kept a "park" of monsters.
However, in the few subsequent expeditions, no traces of Vrak the Rich in 287 to Riga could be found.

The last letters from Vrak came to Ghent on punched gold leaves and date from 214 to Riga. Vrak himself is said to have lost control of the orcs at some point, becoming unsure of their loyalty to him, as the orcs were not satisfied with building a fortress for him. A few envoys returned to Riga in 215, where their trail was lost. Presumably, the gold-stamped "letters" were melted down and sold. Thus, Vrak's legacy succumbed not even to his greed, but to the greed of men.

## Places of interest

For travelers it is recommended to turn back at the highest peak of the haze peaks.
As interesting as hell may be, the damned should be left in these places.
