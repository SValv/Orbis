## The history of the region

The End of the World, Ice World, Icefall or the White Abyss is one of the many names of the region which is the northern border of the known world.
Originally, shortly after the unification of the Empire with the fall of Riga (about 45 years later) it was decided to explore and survey the end of the world, we will agree on "Icefall" to avoid misunderstandings, with a multiply divided expeditionary force of altogether 6500 men (and 18000 tundra sheep).
The success of this expedition is extremely modest, since the ice country was documented in many cases only limited.

When in the year 47 (others claim the year 49) the expedition with the 6500 men left, it was about rediscovering the ,according to legends, incredibly rich mine (iron, gold, copper, phosphorus) of Old Galtosh. For this purpose, the border post "Nordwacht" was revived and expanded into a fort. From Nord Wacht the 13 expidetion troops were supplied and assembled. The whole operation lasted several years and ended, anticlimactically the expeditions gradually lost their men and women to hunger and cold as well as to rock falls, slips and diseases. May the All-God have mercy on their souls.

The first expeditionary force did the best job and probably found the crossing which, according to rumors, some Beastmen used to advance into icefall. The journey of the first expedition ended at the Eisbruch Sea, which is a mostly frozen river with ice sheets piled on top of it. Attempts to cross them were always unsuccessful.  Although on clear days it was possible to see the Meersturz Mountains, it was the changeable weather (fog, snowstorm) and the sometimes ungracious temperatures (tea froze to an icicle when poured) that made ice picking impossible.

But if after the 4th day you are already dragging 2 sheep on your hump, with the best that the alchemist can brew in strengthening potions, you won't get off the spot. Either you get lost, lose a sheep, a pickaxe, a pickaxe breaks or your spirit breaks. Of the 40 men who would have all pushed away the imperial army in arm wrestling, none lasted longer than 5 days. Of 10, we did not even find the body

The second troop fell victim to a rock/ice avalanche that killed all of the 120 men and 40 women except for 4 servants of the All-God. They only found their way to more of the cliffs standing everywhere, on which they suddenly found themselves either on the upper or lower edge.  According to the reports of the servants of the Allgod, they survived only because they prayed longer than usual for the protection of the expedition.

The third troop did not lose any men or women, but they found themselves in a dead end which led through a rocky and ice-slippery depression. According to the report of the expedition leader, only 4 kilometers could be covered during the day.

The 4th troop was attacked, according to reports of the 16 survivors of "mountain devils". Due to poor visibility, you could not adequately describe the creatures. It is probably some kind of mountain troll, possibly it could be unknown orc tribes. In any case, some boulders almost an arm's length in diameter were hurled at the expedition members. However, the "mountain devils" did not make any noise and moved almost silently, so only their shadows were partially visible. In terms of size, opinions differ. Beastmen size, orc size and higher than 2 men stacked was reported.
Accordingly, it is advised to avoid the mountains for the time being.

The fifth expeditionary force, which previously rested in Old Galtosh, was also pelted with rocks. However, this happened during the night, after which the expedition returned, leaving behind about 700 Tundra sheep. The Spheres of the Fifth Troop were unable to cross a Black Shimmering River at the Nameless Mountains because a boulder destroyed the raft, and flying rocks can cause headaches when navigating a river.

The sixth expedition split into two groups after about 2 weeks of marching, both of which ended at the Icebreak Sea. They had the same problems as troop 1: cold, hard, changing weather. However, they were able to determine the position relatively accurately by 2 days with distant visibility and drawings of their seafall mountains.

The seventh expedition was not found. The map only shows where the last remains of Tundra sheep were found.

The eighth expedition met not very happy inhabitants of Eisbruch. This was a lindworm-like creature with fur and saber teeth. Its behavior suggests that it prefers to be a predatory animal.  The animals, called "ice-grippers" by the expedition leader Tranmaach Hiltus, moved relatively effortlessly on the stony, icy terrain and jumped around just as quickly.  Two "ice grabbers" could be dealt with. A mixture of orcs in heavy armor, orcs in heavy armor and orcs and also heavy armor with combat drugs crushed the skull of the ice grabbers and "persuaded" the other 7 ice grabbers to flee, which scholars say indicates social or pack behavior or Lindwurmabstummng.

> Orcs in heavy armor are a stupid idea for expeditions to the end of the world. I haven't encountered any problem yet that would make orcs in heavy armor seem less threatening. The only threatening thing is to explain to the commander that you want to provide orcs in heavy armor for an expedition. Hell, just take enough meat and give them beer with adrenaline and physique and strength potions. [All-god blasphemous paragraph removed by author]. Then the ice grabbers came along. 53 men I lost uh and 4 women I think. Anyway. Are women. Then I wiped them all out along with the orcs on the outside. Then the ice grapplers came again and they got broken bones and smashed skulls. Fucking animals. But the orcs ate so many sheep under drugs that we finally turned back. Damn skinny tundra sheep."

The ninth expedition was probably wiped out by ice-grabbers. 20 stragglers did not find the expedition and returned to Old Galtosh.

The tenth expedition returned to Old Gatosh due to rampant backworm maggot infestations, where they spread the disease. New Galtosh is the settlement before Old Galtosh and holds the remains of the formerly infected and deceased, who cannot be buried.

The 11th expedition returned to Old Galtosh after consuming their food and found no way into the deeper icefall. However, the 11th expedition also returned with some gems which were found on a cliff (the location was crossed out in the official expedition report). The empire then declared this area a restricted zone and began mining gems around 270 after the expedition report was rediscovered, but stopped again in mid-290 as several ice/rock avalanches buried the mining town.

The twelfth expedition returned as planned to the not eternally fronted, but nevertheless cold land behind the Dead Forest and the Dead River. According to the expedition report, this is a tundra-like area with cold but extremely dry expanses. The other side of the Dead Forest turned out to be just as dead and empty of life. Due to superstition, however, the Dead Forest was not explored further because, according to expedition leader Grassius Klanin, the ground takes on "a fleshy consistency" as soon as one stands in it for a moment.
Grassius Klanin, however, was a known drug addict and addicted to Euphorikan. Several of his officers also reported these experiences.
The 12 expeditions ended at the beginning of icebreak because a herd of tundra sheep fled into the Dead Forest, exhausting the supplies.

The 13 expedition probably reached the Icebreak Sea. However, they could not verify whether the Icebreak Sea matched the lake/river they had found.  According to later reports where the 6th, 1st and 13th expeditions exchanged information, the Icebreak Sea seemed to actually go further and reach the Hellhole.

The Hell Hole is a depression in the landscape with almost unnaturally smooth and vertical walls. The bottom of the Hell Hole could not be climbed or seen even after 3 weeks of camping and reconnaissance in 278. Rope descent could only be made to an inter-plateau of about 300mÂ², some 230 meters lower. the men, however, reported muffled booming noises and occasional falling rocks.
The 13th saw in the distance presumably ice grabs which apparently dived in open places of the ice fracture sea and showed themselves disinterested to them opposite.

Expedition leader Maledictian Severian, however, fell ill and asked to be buried at the Icefall Sea. His grave has been lost since then.
