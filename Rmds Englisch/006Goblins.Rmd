Goblins are slightly smaller than dwarves and protrude as far from the ground as the halflings from Yondalla. The common doctrine is that they are an even slightly more basal culture of humanoids than those of the Orcs or Animali.

Their daily life, as long as the sun shines, consists of living hidden in their caves, some of which they have dug themselves. There they light fires at specific fireplaces, sleep in dormitories where they build beds of skins and straw. They eat around the fireplaces. The hunt for stone worms during the day supplements their otherwise meager food supply. Goblins dig tunnels so that they can escape from danger at any time and not be devoured by all the physically superior creations of this world. They have somewhat uniform languages, but have slightly different dialects. The head is a matriarch who bears all the children of the tribe and mates with the tribal shaman and the tribal chief or selected other goblins. Goblins like to refer to their groups or tribes as "Dratin". These Dratins are roughly divided into the three "rulers" mentioned above as well as a worker and warrior caste.

Special are the wandering Djunas, which, in contrast to the Dratin faithful Goblins, actively join other Dratins and try to mate with the Matriach. This is not always crowned with success.

During the day, goblins wander the overworld, hunting game, looting villages and houses, some of which are not guarded. To the chagrin of the peasants, they also steal food from the stores, unless the goblins have a positive relationship with them.

Especially in Yondalla and the east of Eldria, this causes angry peasant gatherings time and again.

Their intellect seems to be in no way inferior to that of humans. Only the problem of the destabilization of the Dratine by an oversupply of food and the following sexual-social tensions seems to keep this species from achieving greater civilizational achievements.

The problem, to go into a little more detail, is that after a (too) sumptuous meal, the goblins become significantly more sexually active. Consequently, power struggles arise, as many goblins try to mate with the matriarch.

In combat, Goblins excel at silent raids with ranged weapons. In direct combat, however, this species is usually clearly inferior to the others. Only halflings are in the same "weight class" here.

> "These small and somewhat ugly creatures, are neither robust nor strong, but they make up for all these inabilities with their agile and devious nature. Goblins excel where other races despair - at night and in dark tunnels. Only those who have never encountered a horde of Goblins consider Elves to be the kings of the night. For unlike elves, there is no hiding from goblins."

## The history of the race

The historiography of the Goblins is unfortunately weak and based on oral traditions. However, there would not be too much to tell. Since Goblins usually live in tribal groups of 75-300, at most 1000 individuals, neither large cities, nor large buildings or other works worthy of history have been created by them.

According to the roughly coinciding oral traditions of the Goblins, they originally came from the southern part of the Sky Peak Mountains. From there they were chased away by "Gob". It is not clear exactly what this "Gob" is. However, sacrificing the dead, burning corpses and killing members of the Dratins seems to be a continuous feature.\
Creatures that can be seen poorly or not at all by the goblins would have to take on the temperature of the environment to hide from them, due to the ability of thermal vision that goblins have. This is true only for bone skulls, except for many-legged creatures.

(what happened in between? who drove them away?)

The goblins call this misfortune "Schojoip" which means "The Expulsion".

Driven from their homeland, goblins migrated to different regions of the known world and are now found especially in rugged and cave-rich landscapes. In some cities, smaller goblin ratins have been able to settle.

Particularly large numbers of goblin tribes are found around the mountains in Yondalla, as well as in the haze peaks located in southern Eldria. In contrast to the mountains around Yondalla, no tribes with a longer history have established themselves in the Haze Peaks.

MaHuk is the Goblin's term for "Hero of the Dratin" or "Hero of the Tribe." Stories are told about either MaHuks or the Matriachirn and mentioned more in passing by regular goblins of the worker or warrior caste, but are never the focus of oral histories.

The greatest deed of the goblins - and one that goblins are only too happy to tell - is the story of MaHuk Korvax, probably the most successful MaHuk in the history of Orbis Astea. Through his superior intellect, he managed to unite many goblin tribes and, in search of the best possible interpretation of the Act of Shojoip (?) (The Expulsion), eventually led them to Yondalla, where a rosy first era supposedly awaited the goblins.\
For historians, however, it is clear that this time must have been long ago, since Yondalla has been inhabited for several centuries and halfling records have never reported any major goblin settlements.

A frequently told and therefore relevant story is that of the matriarch "Seneai". It is probably set somewhat later than that of MaHuk Korvax, and describes the unification of the five tribes around Yondalla. According to the lore, she was able to make special smoke bombs thanks to her Dratin shaman and was able to end the early Yondallian halfling rule, which led to the different Dratins suddenly having enough food available and the new offshoots of the five tribes being able to spread out in all directions. Commonly known to the goblins is the "Feast of Feasts", where goblins coordinately raid local farming villages in large numbers, harassing peasants, rarely killing them, and destroying all valuable looking items in the process.

After the death of said matriarch, the tribal alliance fell apart again. The causes, according to doctrine, are more likely to be found in the nature of goblins than in cunning political intrigues or wars with other species.

## The society of the race

The culture of the Goblins is kept simple. The matriarch, the dratin leader, and the dratin shaman form the cultural and executive head of the community. Workers and warriors are generally disenfranchised from the head of the Dratin and are usually rewarded only by extra rations of food or a place to sleep closer to the nightly fire.\
Punishments consist of prohibition of excessive food intake and, in some cases, harassment by other Dratin members. Less commonly, goblins are used as ritual sacrifices to obtain extra supplies of goblin oil.

The warrior caste is loosely organized and is usually coordinated only for specific raids. Otherwise, goblins are located at exits and at a few scouting points and scout tunnels as upstream eyes. Due to thermal vision, it is extremely difficult to completely wipe out goblin tribes, as they can usually see where the enemy is well in advance.

The food camps are usually placed in the matriarch's chambers, making it impossible to steal food so that other goblins could become sexually active and mature into the matriarch. Dratin shamans form the historical, cultural and ideological heart. A goblin child resulting from the union of shaman and matriarch assumes the new role should the old shaman die or fail to act sufficiently to the matriarch's liking. A Dratin chieftain may be chosen from the regular goblin race, provided he has the favor of the Matriarch and is popular or esteemed among the rest of the goblins for special merit.

The Matriarch herself is shown only to Dratin members, and is also the first to be evacuated in case of trouble, or defended to the death against invaders or enemies.

### The Race's Race Relations

Goblin, not surprisingly, do not maintain diplomatic relations with major empires, only with individual humanoids of the overworld. These relations are consequently independent of large-scale political events, such as the Empire's war against the Rah Kari.

Because of their penchant for dark places, ambushes, and the use of poisons, they are often mistaken by other races for vermin to be removed. However, these attempts not infrequently fail. In particular, the hatred of the Yondallese people towards goblins is great, and there is a general bounty on goblins in Yondalla.

Since the Empire's occupation, this hatred has subsided, as goblins, after suffering heavy losses, do not dare to fight against the heavily armed Imperial Army.

It is worth mentioning that some orc tribes consider goblins as food and consume them like halflings at their feasts.

## Biology of the species

Matriarchs lead groups of 75 to 500 goblins, the matriarch herself usually mates with the tribal leader or the tribal shaman. Rarely, the matriarch will mate with a group member who has performed better for the group, these are called Djunas (Bosnian for penis, Indian first name). (really the same abastz twice?)

Djunas are among the only members of a tribe who actively seek out other tribes to be included. Djunas are born without the characteristic feature of their tribe and then leave it soon. Djunas then try to be accepted into other tribes and mate with the matriarch. It is possible in a tribe or "dratin" for ordinary goblins, of the worker or warrior class, to rise to the position of tribe leader, either through accumulated achievements or simple goodwill of the matriarch. The Matriarch is generally fat and permanently pregnant, due to about four times the food supply that must be fed to her compared to a normal Goblin. The majority of a Goblin Dratin is made up of workers, 7 out of 8 are of the worker class, these are generally raised on somewhat meager food. Unlike the Djunas, should they have succeeded in mating with a matriarch, who receive the most food even slightly more than warriors. The sexuality of a goblin develops only after a certain level of food supply. This leads to instability in the Primal tribes (?). This also leads to smaller tribes forming many djunas in the event of a spontaneous abundance of food.

(but is the prerequisite nit that Djunas are born without typical tribal characteristics?)

The goblins' diet consists primarily of hunted prey, which creates food competition with other races on the surface. Underground, Goblins usually hunt stone worms, additionally they feed on mushrooms, which are occasionally traded for with humans or halflings. Goblins are the only humanoids that can naturally see a warm-blooded night even in the blackest night. This is because they possess thermal vision. In addition to the thermal vision that is common knowledge, this is also extremely impervious to acid which makes hunting stone worms much easier. Living goblins are no more flammable than other creatures, but after their demise, an easily combustible liquid develops in the goblins' carcasses. Goblin shamans take advantage of this effect by tying off one of their arms so they can start fires at any time.

Unlike the other humanoid races, the Goblins have historically had no known problem with Awakened. It is known that killed Goblins resurrect as Awakened, but this does not happen in Goblins Dratins, because the corpses are ritualistically burned. This is the task of the Dratins shaman and, thanks to the combustibility of the goblin corpses, does not require firewood.

Goblins hunt and consume stone worms, which contain a high concentration of minerals due to their diet. This causes the goblin oils, which can be extracted from the carcasses, to have different colors when burned. According to imperial alchemists, this is due to the ores and metals accumulating in the fatty tissue, and serves as an identifying mark, at least among the five tribes around Yondalla, as well as an aid to smelting ores, for simple tool and weapon making.

Another bloodline specific characteristic of the Goblins are slightly different body features. Colorations of the skin, tufts of hair on the shoulders, and the shape of the ears form the most common and the most defined features here.

## The religion of the race

In the beginning there was Gob and Gob, the darkness that surrounded everyone, cold dead stone and warm living prey but one did not follow this rule, one was cold as stone and yet alive. This one or this many followed wherever one went, it always followed death, death by hunting or death of a friend. And so death followed more death. Thus one learned death did not like it to be lonely. Time passed and death was always followed by death, until that day when friend Jegovha hit stone on stone and death not death was followed only by light and dancing shadows. Jegovha, however, saw one thing and realized the truth, these messengers of the Creator came to punish them, entertained Gob with the dancing shadows so he did not demand another life. (makes kan sense)

### death cult

> "In my studies of these ugly little creatures, I have come to an astonishing discovery. Goblins burned their dead. But how was this possible? Earlier findings have established that goblins originated in the mountains, in barren caves with little vegetation. How could they find enough fuel there? The answer is as simple as it is perplexing. Goblins were flammable, not in the sense that you hold a torch to their arm and they burn brightly, but rather a liquid seems to form in their bodies that is highly flammable. Their tribal shaman cleverly exploits this property and uses it in their death ritual."

## The legends of the race

## The proper terms of the race

## Tribal structure

Each tribe has a tribal leader and each tribal leader has a tribal shaman. This team of two leads the tribe. The tribal leader is the goblin chosen to advance the tribe through an idea, so it is almost amusing to watch from the outside as one silly idea tries to trump another. With the shamans it is different. This role is inherited and thus forms the most solid existing link in the hierarchy. The influence of a shaman is not to be underestimated, so he is not only the mouthpiece of their god Gob, but is also not to be underestimated in fighting power, because the flammable liquids, which are used in the death rituals, he also knows how to use in battle.
