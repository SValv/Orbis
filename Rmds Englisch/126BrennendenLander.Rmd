# The burning countries

To the rich of men, the Burning Lands consist only of the lore and accounts of some goblin tribes in the eastern mountains of Yondalla. The oral reports that we scholars have received are so unnatural that they were initially dismissed as dreams of the goblins. A few, now deceased scholars, however, tried to gather more information about the few friendly goblin tribes in the mountains of Yondalla, confirming and contradicting some different stories.

The translations are of course not free of errors and offer here only an insight.

> "If we always walk to the sunrise, only the most unreasonable scouts go on unperturbed and usually pay with their lives. These countries are so close to the sun that we would only die of thirst there and burn internally. Therefore, we no longer go to the countries of the sun and turn back at the latest at the sun summit [presumably a mountain]. It is the last resting point from which one can overlook the sun lands and the otherness of them. You can see black trees and the ground is hot, so hot that we can only walk briefly with thick shoes."

> Voris Big Tooth - Shaman of the Big Tooth Tribe

> "The lands beyond Sunstorm Mountain are evil. It is as if Gob [The Darkness - according to the Goblins' beliefs] were still there even though the sun shines brightly on everything. We do not go to the lands beyond Sunstorm Mountain. We have lost many good members of our tribe. The land is possessed by Gob. Anyone who walks down the ridge of Sunstorm Mountain breaks out his meal no later than when he reaches the base of the mountain. Whoever then turns back survives with luck and blessings of the shaman. He who does not turn back falls down and does not get up again."

> Gokin Black Arm - tribal leader of the Capricorn tribe

> "I tell you, you night-blind people with your iron armor, these lands are burning. You cannot see it because you are not endowed with the blessings of our kind. If you go behind the top of the skull, you will die as soon as you reach the foot of the mountain. You will burn inside and you will regurgitate your food. Even if you turn back then, the curse of the burning lands will haunt you and you will long for a quick death. Your skin will turn black like the night you fear, and then you will return to Gob."

> Jinien Blue Lamb - Tribal Shaman of the Granite Hole Tribe

These three reports all suggest the existence of the lands east of the mountain range around Yondalla. Other reports from goblins and the few expeditions of humans also prove the existence. However, nothing could be said about the "black trees" or the "curse" of the burning lands until now. Mostly the expeditinoes turned back after a few days already, because the attacks of the goblins were not survivable in the detourable and rugged terrain at night.

Attempts by humans to explore the rugged depression east of the borderland known as the Sulphur Rift, popularly called the Hellmouth, usually resulted in the blue sulphur fires setting materials or men ablaze at night. The most far-reaching exploration tour ended with an anlbick of an extremely steep mountain cliff which could only be climbed by individual trained mountaineers, marks the end here. The brittleness of this cliff makes the climb even more difficult. Thus, already with arrow shots larger chunks of the cliff broke off again and again.

> The constantly flaring sulfur fires and invisible fires, which could only be avoided thanks to a goblin leader from the black-armed tribe, proved to be such a nuisance that further advancement beyond the sulfur trench was impossible.
>
> Also, a disease of the air must be reported which was probably caused by the bad air. Hereby after 3-4 days the people began to vomit and the goblin leader also gradually lost his vitality, forcing us to turn back.
>
> Even days after we were out of the sulfur trench and we had slipped into warm clothes and we were washed by vinegar, many of my companions died of weakness of life. Their skin first turned red, then pale, and then black as they slowly returned to the realms of the All-God. I will never return to the Sulphur Trench. If the All-God wished it, he would not put a damned hellgate there and have us constantly watched by faceless distorted types of chalky pale horses."

> "Of Orcs, Werewolves and the Gate to Hell"

High Inquisitor Oranius Bahrenjaege also publicly expressed the claim that the Sulphur Rift may be of diabolical proportions, since the accounts of the Called of Jiraad had visions and dreams very similar to the descriptions Sir Maxian Johnathan Molesworth gave to Vaichatum about the area.

## The history of the region

*People unknown story:*

*The Burning Lands have long served as the retreat of the Blood God Jiraad. Jiraad seeks to create his own creations of monsters and more intelligent beings in these lands to counter the Blood Goddess Ga'ar and her incarnations of Ashworms and Worldworms

*The burning lands are highly radioactively contaminated, making it impossible for ordinary organisms to survive or gain a foothold there in the long term. Due to the higher mutation rate of the organisms which can eke out an existence by Jiraad itself or via strong selection, significantly more abstruse life forms have evolved which would be considered grotesque or unnatural by humans

*Since monsters and wild animals are hardly suitable to fight against Aschw√ºrmer or world worms Jiraad tried to create his own variants of intelligent living beings, which was only conditionally successful. These boneless galert-like organisms can barely move upright outside of their special armor. Without these armors, these "witnesses of Jiraad" or "Jiraadites" crawl along at a leisurely pace, feeding on radiation via symbiotic fungi. These fungi give pitch-black or purple colors to most of the organisms of the burning lands. The peculiarity of these witnesses of Jiraad is the ability to unite with other witnesses of Jiraad in order to carry out a comparison of the collected knowledge. \
Jiraad wanted to achieve that the knowledge about the most effective methods of fighting the ash- and worldworms of Ga'ar would spread so fast. The plan worked conditionally. It is true that individual groups of Jiraad's witnesses (also called "Zeujards") can become dangerous to the worms.\
\
However, the possibility for knowledge matching has the consequence that these galertigen creatures forged an own will and own plans. Other creations quickly perished from the chaotic geological conditions.\
Jiraad tries, somewhat unsuccessfully, to lure humanoids with visions of the Burning Lands or the Sulphur Rift into his realm, where he would have greater influence. However, due to the unfamiliarity of the lands, extremely few humans find their way to the Sulphur Rifts or would survive long enough to be biologically adapted by Jiraad.\
\

## Economic Situation

*Zeujards organize themselves through unification festivals where a larger number of Zeujards share their accumulated knowledge and organize resources for armor and weapons. Technically superior to humans, but dependent on the support of their creator, they do not leave the burning lands
