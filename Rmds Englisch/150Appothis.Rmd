# Appothis

Appothis is the eastern part of the Rah Kari territory and the second largest region belonging to the Rah Kari. This region has experienced a lot of history and has lost some of it as well, since long ago it was the region connected to Eldria, but the Istval Rockfall, which devastated both Appothis and Eldria and created the new region now known as Misty Grove, separated Rah Kari from the other human kingdoms. Appothis consists of a large desert and numerous mountains located in both the north and south of the region. It also borders the Setra River, which has many settlements that benefit from the ecosystem created by the river. Appothis borders many other regions, such as the aforementioned Misty Grove, Wormfall, Berma Valley and Atumpet.

## Villages of the region

### Keshep

> In Keshep, the bond of Kah' Fan and Tarkus Rah lasts forever, as it is and will probably always be a city of craftsmen and soldiers
>
> --- Proverb of the Rah' Kari

Keshep is the oldest Rah Kari settlement in Appothis and has been the stronghold of Rah Kari military power since its founding. The city is located in the center of the region and has roads leading to Mist Grove and lower Appothis. It is said that Keshep is the safest city next to Atumpet, as Keshep houses the majority of the Rah Kari forces. It is said that any other faction that would invade Rah Kari territory from the north would tremble at the first sight of Keshep's walls and its forces. Keshep's walls are the most massive in the world and in themselves one of the most impressive sights the world has to offer. The only time Keshep's might has been tested was during the slave revolt, though even during that Keshep was never seriously threatened.

Keshep is not only known for its military strength. It also houses the best and most specialized craftsmen in Rah Kari. Almost all materials obtained in Misty Grove are transported through Keshep or remain in Keshep. For this reason, many craftsmen stay in the city, as this is where they have the best access to these resources. On the other hand, many travelers and merchants form their caravans or travel groups in the city before leaving for their expeditions.

### Quissa

Quissa is said to be the most beautiful city in Appothis. The city is surrounded by an oasis and is the last patch of civilization before the Wormfall. It is the hotspot for travelers trying to reach the mysterious Iron Red Desert. Many travelers describe the city as full of entertainment and excitement, enough to quench the thirst of even the most adventurous.

Quissa may be beautiful, but its beauty overshadows the many dangers that surround it. It is surrounded by scorching desert, mountains full of dangers, monsters, and the ever-changing Wormfall. The city is relatively young at 230 years old, but is one of the fastest growing cities in the entire region.

### Napnopet

Napnopet is one of the greatest wonders of Appothis. It is a city built in and around the skeleton of a powerful world worm and many other worms.

The city acts as a trading post between the Rah Kari and the Dwarves to the south, and as one of the rest stops before Quissa. The city is also one of the only tourist spots in Appothis and many people flock to the city to see all its wonders, especially the magnificent palace built into the head of the World Worm.

However, the city is not free of problems, as it hosts many gangs that harass and steal from the inhabitants of Napnopet. Napnopet is one of the largest transshipment points for illegal substances in Appothis.

### Bokarun Mine

The Bokarun Mine is located in the south of the region and is the main hub for construction materials in the region. Granite and several other ores are mined at the Bokarun mine; Atumpet, for example, was built primarily from granite extracted from the mine.

Bokarun granite has become sinfully expensive over time, as it has become a status symbol for the magnificent buildings of the upper Rah Kari, and it is now transported throughout the Rah Kari Empire.

### Esunpet and Wisunpet

Esunpet and Wisunpet are the only major cities located on the border of the Misty Grove. They both serve as a checkpoint and military outpost for Appothis. Both cities were built 100 years before Riga and have only grown in importance since then. Originally, the cities were built as outposts to monitor all activity in and out of the Misty Grove and served as the starting point for all expeditions into Misty Grove.

Since then, the cities have gained economic value, as all goods and items coming from the Misty Grove must pass through the cities. These goods are among the most important imports in the region, and many people want to get their hands on them. However, Esunpet and Wisunpet are not the safest places in Appothis. Many dangers emanate from the Misty Grove, which is why strong military forces are stationed in both cities in case any dangers approach the cities. Often there are threats from monsters, which is why monster hunters are often found in these cities. Another threat is the black markets in the outskirts of the city, where many illegal goods are sold to the highest bidders. Such markets always have a habit of attracting criminal scum that causes blood in the streets.

### Ahmes

Between Keshep and the mountains near Setra lies an ancient ruin called Ahmes. Ahmes is believed to be the site of an ancient civilization from times past, where scholars deciphered the words of the gods. Although the ruins on the surface are extraordinary, it is the ruins beneath the surface that are the true treasure of Ahmes.

Beneath the surface of the desert, Ahmes extends deep into the earth. The endless corridors of Ahmes contain an unimaginable amount of text, and it is said that humans have not yet succeeded in exploring the entire ruin. The famous scholar Murdus even said that the ruins are endless. The scholars of today have tried again and again to decipher the texts of Ahmes, but without success. The texts cannot be read by any human, and the Rah Kari have even tried to bring researchers from all over the world to interpret the texts, but so far no one has succeeded. Any human would believe that Ahmes is already filled with enough difficulties, but one of the biggest challenges is getting to Ahmes, as the ruins sometimes disappear into the desert. This has led to many people being trapped in the ruins and perishing. The only way to find the ruins is to find the Hubasa tribe and gain their trust. Many scholars try to do this, but the tribe is hard to find because they spend most of their time traveling and do not consider everyone worthy of learning Ame's secrets.

### Infrastructure

The safest and best roads in Appothis are those leading to and from Keshep. They are most used by merchants and frequently patrolled by the military.

Second only to the roads from Keshep are the roads around Setra. These roads are filled with villagers selling their goods to the surrounding larger towns and caravans bringing all these goods to Atumpet. The only roads left are the ones to Wurmfall. These roads are by far the most dangerous, as they are often lined with monsters and bandits.

## The history of the region

### Early history of Appothis

The history of Appothis begins with the Hu. Fortunately, much is known of their history due to their numerous oral storytellers, although it seems rather uneventful in the grand scheme of world history. The Hu were a nomadic people who devoted themselves primarily to riding and raising horses. This tradition still lives on in Appothis and among the Meth-Hu people.

The Hu were not peace-loving nomads, but in many cases shepherds and cattle drovers, who left their herds now and then to rob and plunder. So there is a long series of stories, which Hu tribe did not like which Hu tribe or which blood feuds were the most extensive.

After some time the Hu discovered the settlements on the Atum, which were outposts of Appothis, and plundered them. After some time Atumpet sent troops, but they could not do much against the skilled cavalry of the Hu. The troops sent out, however, led the Hu to Atumpet - a city that amazed the Hu in ways they had never seen before, such was its size and magnificence, especially for the Hu, who had not seen more than settlements of perhaps 150 men in their lives.

Quickly, the first Hu tribes began to attack Atumpet to plunder its infinite riches. Not a single Hu warrior was able to defeat the walls of Atumpet.

> We did not know where to go, our horses - undefeated in the field - were shot like birds by their arrow throwers on the walls. We did not know this kind of fight.
>
> -- Narrator of the Hu, Orenlan

The greed of the Hu, who did not want to give up the riches of Atumpet, dared the unthinkable - the Hu formed an alliance of over 120 tribes. The Hu had never seen such a mass of troops, over 11000 men, of which almost 7000 were horsemen - an unbeatably large force in their opinion.
The Hu alliance attacked with united forces - less than 1400 warriors returned, the walls of Atumpet were not broken.

This defeat broke the will of the Hu, and many tribes gathered two moons later to discuss the situation. A young tribal leader named Kesh managed to convince most of the Hu tribes that the only way to move into the future was to join the people of Atumpet and settle down themselves.

> If you want to live like the rich people of Atumpet, you must act like the rich people of Atumpet. Leave the old clans and build. Build houses, walls, fields, and leave the ways of our ancestors
>
> -- Kesh from the Hu

This event is generally seen as the end of the Hu. They split into the Keshen, who became sedentary and after whom Keshep was named - and the "true" Hu, the Meth-Hu, who still live as nomads in the deserts and are historically insignificant.

### The time before the Rah' Kari

The Keshen founded Keshep, still the second largest city in the south, as well as many other settlements in Appothis, all as independent city-states with loose alliances and enmities. They still retained their penchant for horse breeding, but were never to become as good at it as the Hu were or the Meth-Hu still are today.
This period of history is seen today mainly as a time of construction, about which, however, not so much is known, since the storytelling tradition of the Hu fell victim to the cultural change of the Keshen and the institution of historiography returned to Appothis only with the Rah' Kari. Judging by the findings, however, the Keshen tried to attack Atumpet even more often without success, an endeavor to which many young Keshen fell victim.

When the Rah' Kari took Atumpet from the west, the Keshen realized that they needed a united army against the great power of the Rah' Kari, so they gathered again, with the Sharif of Quissa - Amair - asserting himself as leader.

### The invasion of the Rah' Kari

This chapter coincides with the [War of the Lower Desert of the Rah' Kari](#WarOfTheLowerDesert) and can be read there. After a long back and forth, the Keshen forces were defeated and the Keshen gradually dissolved into the Rah' Kari. The battlefield is the birthplace of the [lost army](#lostarmy)

### The Slave Revolts

Similar to the [greater uprising in Eid' Rah' Kari](#SlaveUrisingRahKari), many slaves in Atumpet escaped and fled into the desert, where they received much support from the Meth-Hu - an act because of which the Meth-Hu are still hated by many of the Rah' Kari today. Many slave groups were found by the guardians and wiped out, while still others joined the Meth-Hu.

The largest slave army under a slave named Kah'Leih was lured into the [lost army](#lostarmy) with clever maneuvers by the guardians, where they met a gruesome end and once again strengthened the army of the undead.

## Economic situation

### The resources of the region

The largest and most important resource in Appothis is granite from the Bokarun mine. The granite is mainly used for construction in Appothis and other cities such as Keshep. Other ores and minerals are also extracted from the mine, but not in the quantity as granite.
Another export of the region is ceramics. Ceramics are made in many smaller towns, but the best and most elegant examples are made and sold in Keshep. Other products include foodstuffs harvested in all the villages near Setra, as well as monster materials and smaller constructions from the dwarves in the south. Last but not least, many slaves are captured, born and sold in this region.

## Sociopolitical Situation

Much of the political environment of Appothis revolves around Keshep and its threats. Some of these threats is the Lost Army, an army of 100,000 undead that roams the deserts. Keshep's troops must keep a constant eye on the army to keep it away from any settlements.
Another threat is the rebels of the 9th Cult. It is said that the largest rebel groups are found in this region and it is not uncommon for them to raid settlements.

In addition, the son of Tarkus Rah and the son of Kah' Fan traditionally stay mostly in Keshep, making their safety and intentions a high priority.

### The lost army {#lostarmy}

In Appothis there is an army of circa. 100,000 undead. This host was created during the slave revolt and has been a thorn in the side of the state ever since, as it must constantly expend resources to keep the army from invading its towns and villages. So far, the state has been spared from disasters related to the army, but the intelligence service and the Inquisition of the Empire are always in the dark, trying to use the army as a weapon against the Rah Kari.

### Other factions in Appothis

#### Rebels and Bandits

Appothis is home to an unusually high number of bandits and rebels compared to the regions of Rah Kari. The desert often proves to be a natural hiding place for these people, as it is often impossible to track them over a long distance. Most of them are either runaway slaves or extremely poor people who have nowhere else to go and try to find a better life by turning to banditry.

#### The Meth-Hu

The Meth-Hu are the indigenous people of Appothis, now consisting only of nomadic tribes scattered throughout Appothis. This people is extremely wary of outsiders and tries to avoid anyone they do not know. The Meth-Hu do not share the same religion as the rest of Rah Kari. They believe in other gods, which makes them a constant target and leads to bounty hunters often trying to hunt them down for the reward of each Meth-Hu head. Also, the Meth-Hu are believed to hold the knowledge of Asb' Kartes' legacy, and therefore many people seek them out to obtain this information. Be it from people who support them or from people who are after them for their knowledge.

## Climatic conditions

### The flora and fauna

#### Monsters in the region

##### Sand Demons {.unnumbered}

In Appothis there are many predators that prey on humans, but one of the most notorious are the sand demons. These creatures lurk in sandstorms that they can somehow control and create, an act that no scholar has yet been able to explain. They use the sandstorms to divert humans from their path, and then work with other predators to kill the humans.

## Rumors of the region

### The sand turtles

They say that sand flattens everything with time and that the only thing left after hundreds of years are the legends of the past. One of these legends is the story of the sand turtle. People believe that somewhere in the desert, near the Iron Red Desert, there is a giant sand turtle. If a traveler manages to guess 3 questions, he can drink from the tears of the turtle. It is said that if someone drinks the tears of this animal, he will see visions of a safe way through the wormfall. Many people believe that the first travelers who managed to get into the Iron Red Sausages used this method to return alive, and even today people are looking for the sand turtle to find a way to the red paradise of the desert.

Many predominant peoples have attempted to track the sand turtle in order to obtain safe travel routes and trade routes into the Iron Red Desert. One of these men was Fesri of the Trade Route, who was famous for his trade between Eid' Tanis and Eid Rah Kari. Fesri invested a large sum of his fortune in this endeavor and hundreds of men began to work on this task. However, this task eventually became the great merchant's undoing, as it proved impossible to find the sand turtle. Many people died in the desert and many others disappeared near the border of the Wormfall and it was not long before Fesri could no longer find people to work for him and after a few years the project was abandoned.

### Ol Talib

Legends tell of a mysterious old man who helps travelers cross the desert. This man has been mentioned only a few times in history, but all accounts say the same thing. This man has a ship with which he can cross the desert, and the records say that the wind accompanied him everywhere. Moreover, the man calls himself Ole Talib and was last seen in 1900 when he helped a group of travelers who got lost on the way to the "oasis city".

### The swamp teeth

All trade from Misty Grove is heavily regulated in Appothis. Many diseases can be brought into Appothis by items and goods from Misty Grove, so it has become extremely difficult to acquire goods from there. However, a group of smugglers has repeatedly managed to sneak past Rah Kari's security forces and bring goods to the country's black market. This group calls itself the Swamp Teeth and is led by the infamous leader Set-em-ash. Set-em-ash used to be a legendary archer in Rah Kari's army, and people said that he was unsurpassed as a horse archer. However, after his general blindly sent him and his unit into a battle that only he and three others survived, he lost his faith in the military. After that, he became a brigand and bandit who had much success thanks to his military knowledge, but it wasn't until he began leading his team to Misty Grove that he gained notoriety. Set-em-ash ventured into the ruins of Misty Grove and its lost cities and acquired various valuables there. People also hired him and his crew to smuggle other goods and materials into the country that would otherwise have been impossible to obtain. Some rich and influential families even used him to retrieve family heirlooms and other important items from influential families who used to live where Misty Grove is now located. Many people believed Set-em-ash had allied with the Animali tribe to conquer the swamps of Misty Grove. The bounty on the Swamp Teeth's head is enormous, but so far no bounty hunters, adventurers, or even the military have managed to capture the group, and until then they will remain one of the most legendary groups of outlaws to roam the plains of Appothis.
