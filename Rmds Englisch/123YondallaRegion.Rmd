Yondalla is geographically bordered by the territories of the Empire and the Night Mountains.

The Empire is bordered by the Borderland and Heartland regions. Yondalla, with its capital Yonda, is one of the most densely populated countries of all and even surpasses Eldrian standards in this respect.

The numerous rivers that flow out of the Night Mountain range provide valuable nutrients to the soil of Yondalla. Thus, Yondalla achieves a significant food surplus, which, due to the protectorate of the Empire, no longer falls into the hands of bandits or the countless raids of goblin tribes.

The population of Yondalla, besides the absence of orcs, consists of halflings and humans. The population of Yondalla lives in a relatively free society. Thus, different religions come together and a certain melting pot of customs can be observed in the Valley of Night Mountains.

Economically, due to the very fertile lands, there is a lack of higher manufacturing trades, which are slowly establishing themselves with the cunning businessmen and craftsmen of the Empire. Meanwhile, the role of the pacified region is as a supplier of food and alchemy ingredients. Far less important is ore extraction. Rarer metals such as gold and silver are often suspected, but due to the adversities of the Night Mountains, it has not yet been possible to extract these treasures. Goblins, harsh winters and flooding of the tunnels are, in addition to irritable Schratg√§rtnern challenges that private entrepreneurs are reluctant to take on, especially since a glaring shortage of useful and mountain-going mercenaries prevails.

The Empire, however, promised some years ago to explore the Night Mountains reasonably and to establish mines, but so far in 426 A.D. no relevant projects have been carried out.

## Villages of the region

### Yonda

Yonda is the capital of Yondalla. Built on the "Rock of Titan", a large granite plateau about 30 meters high through which the "Night River", a tributary of the Reik River, has cut its way, it offers protection from the spring floods, a safe retreat from goblins, who can hardly cut tunnels through the granite, as well as protection from the hunting orc tribes, which until a few decades ago were real horror stories for the halflings of Yondalla. Yonda itself has a flourishing society of food-processing trades, as well as an ideal transport possibility by ship towards Civis Primae.

Since the occupation by the Empire, which is generally considered "tolerable" by the population, the safety from orcs is given, at least in the larger settlements of the halflings.

Population: 660,000

### Alla

The second largest city in Yondalla and the reason for the second part of the region's name, the city of Alla is much closer to the Night Mountains and, like Yonda, provides a lot of food that can be transported by ship to Civis Primae via the Illond, the second largest feeder of the Reik. Alla is characterized by a relatively large number of stationed legionaries, as well as a militarily organized and trained troop of halflings. The "children's troop", made fun of by the legionaries, could at least defend their wealth against hungry orcs and deceitful goblins for a long time, which resulted in a "militarized" city.

Trades are the crossbowmen and the bow works, and economically most relevant the food trades, as well as the "best confectioners and bakers in the world". I myself can confirm this, nothing beats a night stollen nud fresh cream with a view of the slopes of the night mountains on a clear summer evening

Population: 450,000

### Ollian:

The city on the border of the Empire's heartland has historically traded with humans for a long time and sells, at a profit, foodstuffs that arrive in Ollian via the merging Odrian, Ovian, and Obuskus rivers.

Besides a small but well-educated stonemason and shipwright guild, Ollian captivates with three charismatic dwarven families, like "the dirt on my boots after fieldwork", who guide the fortunes of the city.

Marble mining is another pillar, besides the typical alchemical and consumable goods, and has been massively expanded since the occupation due to the ostentation in Civis Primae, much to the chagrin of the halflings, who are unsuited for such work.

Population: 110,000

### Infrastructure

Yondalla is characterized by rivers from the Night Mountains. These form ideal routes for the rapid transport of foodstuffs. The roads are usually less safe than the rivers, but at least the relevant towns are passable by market carts and double-horse carriages.

Ferries form the historical river crossing method, but are gradually being replaced by bridges due to measures taken by the Empire.

## The history of the region

It is not known exactly how long Yondalla has been settled. Stories go back many centuries and may be close to the Rah-Kari.

Agriculture was established early. Mild climate, drier summers, good soils allowed the physically weak halflings to specialize in all kinds of agriculture.

Conflicts used to arise with orcs, who liked to eat halflings, as well as with the local goblin tribes, who brought chaos to the lands while plundering the granaries and fields.

Militarily, Yondalla was never able to hold its own, and only cooperation with the Empire allowed for a more peaceful time and the pushback of the goblin and orc tribes. Since the annexation by the Empire, officially presented as a protectorate, the economic conditions have improved and are thus tolerated by the good part of the population.

As a result, independence movements exist only in the poorer regions along the Perla and Vohra rivers.

## Economic situation

Yondalla is economically extremely well positioned and the last famine was over 340 years ago - remember - despite the raids of goblins and the terror of orcs.

Although less skilled in crafts than the guilds of the Empire, or the skilled hands of the elves, Yondalla benefits from the exchange with the Empire.

Primarily, food is exported in various forms. Ore mining does not cover its own needs by far. Deforestation over the last centuries is slowly raising the price of wood.

Export of alchemical goods was extremely lucrative, especially in wartime of the empire. In peacetime, it is a useful sideline for Yondall's peasants.
