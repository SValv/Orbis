# The dwarfs

![A dwarf](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Dwarf.jpg)

This neither large nor very robust race, survives only because of its superior intellect. This leads to a certain arrogance, which is reinforced by their other less charismatic characteristics. Due to their tendency to trade, this people starts with a much more bulging purse than others, which they are ready to defend with everything they have. This gives them an advantage in all negotiations that involve money in any form.

## The history of the race

The Dwarves claim the title of the oldest humanoid race on the continent. However, there is no one who can confirm this. In general, it is believed by less benevolent scholars that this was the result of a campaign to raise the reputation of the Dwarves some 270 years ago. This was to portray this physically slight race as more respectable, whiter, and "all-knowing."
Promotional literature from Balbobräu, probably the largest beverage company in the known world, stated:
> "We know the beginning of time! Taste the accumulated experience of hundreds of generations of master brewers!"
> Balbobräu.

Without a doubt the dwarves are a very old race. Ruins of their earlier much more widespread cities, which you put in the corridors of worms underidish, clearly prove longer verifiable traces. However, it must be remembered that although orcs do not leave such fundamental buildings, no one doubts that orcs have lived on this world longer than the Rahkari Empire has existed.

Dwarves, however, rarely left things of consequence in abandoned dwarven cities. Scribbles about "A debtor lives in this house" to "Chisels are not made of dwarven steel. May the lindworm eat you while you shit" reveal basic traits of old dwarven life here.
However, it is not easy to get information out of dwarves, because they demand money for the one-sided exchange of information.
According to old inscriptions, as well as paid dwarven historians, the "first" royal dynasty is called Umgar "the Red". However, dating is not possible because earthquakes caused an archive to collapse and burn down.
In all likelihood, the dwarves lived under the iron hand of Umgar's dynasty in very strong cooperation. Wealth and treasures were shared communally, even with distant relatives, if Umgar's power apparatus demanded it.
The reasons for Umgar's "greed" are not exactly known, however. He was neither pompous, nor did the family frequently instigate wars for prestige.  Accordingly, there are rumors about what the Umgars actually wanted.
It is said that the first of the Umgar family was entrusted with a task. Some think the task was to make the dwarves the most successful corporation of Orbis Astea, others think it was surely to accumulate all the riches and others again, though much quieter speak of keeping the horror imprisoned in the depths. The Thunder Guardians still active in Vandia, a half-lost dwarven city, hold this view.

One thing is certain, however: the dwarven people, once united under the red banner of Clan Umgar, dedicated themselves to the task of amassing resources, exploring Orbis, and acquiring anything valuable they could get their hands on. They were especially interested in ores for robust metals, which is why they often dug deep into the mountain and followed wormholes deeper than people with a clear mind would ever do. During this time, there was brotherly sharing between all the dwarves, trying to have enough for everyone while still dedicating themselves to the task at hand.
But as the years went by, greed among the dwarven people evolved into a very selfish affair. What caused the upheaval is unclear. Possibly the Umgar's lost influence, or suddenly there was not enough for everyone. The result remained the same: everyone wanted more, but not for the task, but for themselves.
> What good are the greatest treasures if you have to give everything away?
> Widespread daubing in abandoned dwarf towns.
 
The clan Umgar was even insinuated to keep all these treasures for themselves, that no task existed at all. With this thought the revolution ignited. In each of the now numerous and well-connected cities of the dwarves, the conflict flared up. "Progressives" against the king loyalists who proudly raised their royal red banners, the latter being clearly in the minority. Greed had burned too far into the hearts of the dwarves. During this time, known to historians only as the End of Sharing, the tunnels filled with the blood of the dwarves.

![Faction of the Royals](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/FactionTheRoyals.jpg)

Many dwarven cities did not survive this civil war and are now only ruins that bore deep into the realm of the earth, others collapsed entirely under the weight of the war, burying entire clans, and still others were so weakened that the cities could no longer withstand the attacks of the other races that scent wealth. The clan Umgar itself disintegrated into many small parts scattered throughout the cities. However, the lineage of the king survived, albeit deprived of its power.

![Dwarf in the ashes of the dwarf kingdom](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/FightDwarf.jpg)


![Defense against invasions](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/FightingDwarf.jpg)


The last attempt of Umgar's followers to rally and turn the tide took place in what is now the region of Eldria, more precisely in the city of Vandia. The dwarves had established good relations with the humans there for hundreds of years and built a massive city there. This last resistance gathered its forces and resources for a counterattack. In anticipation of the enemy dwarves, the constructs of the city were rebuilt to spare only those dwarves with a tattoo of Umgar's followers. But all hope was dashed when the only known true dragon destroyed the city and wiped out the last great gathering of Umgar's followers.



The cities that remained watched this happen and went into seclusion on Earth, burying almost all entrances to ward off invaders and almost completely losing contact with their cousins.

In their isolation, a whole new system of their own developed due to the desire for more wealth as a catalyst. However, as with other peoples, this drive could not be satisfied by expansion and conquest. The dwarves had to make the best of this limited space, so they honed their skills, knowledge and abilities. The poverty of resources demanded an accurate assessment of the price and usefulness of all kinds of objects and services. As a result, dwarves became true masters of trade and craftsmanship.

The times of voluntary isolation created "newly hatched dwarves" with new ideas. This is what Orcs and Rahkari called the striking difference of the dwarves. Every word and every stone was weighed in the balance. Everything had to be precisely documented to know exactly when , where , how much of what might be needed. This was a novelty even for the well organized merchant caste of the Rahkari. This led incidentally to the restriction of the permits to dwarf traders who are allowed to move away from the main cities. They put too much pressure on local "unorganized" traders. The Empire and the loose confederation of the Eldrians had a similar situation. Where dwarves were tolerated, suddenly all the wealth of the village gathered in two small hands.

These led to absurdities such as advertising in false dwarven history books:

> As everyone knows, the history of the dwarves is closely intertwined with the history of Balbobräu. For nothing a dwarf prefers to spend his money than for Balbobräu. Here a comprehensive greeting to the friendly and unselfish sponsor Balbobräu without which this work would not have been possible.
Balbobräu was of course completely uninvolved in the great fall of Istval. This serious event represents a turning point in the use of explosives among the dwarves. Malicious tongues claim that the workers at that time, almost 700 years ago, would have been alcoholic after a merry round of Balbobräu, but everyone knows only responsible dwarves enjoy this tasty treat.
A dwarf town was leveled to the ground just under 700 years ago due to a mistake in handling explosive materials, and today's <font color="green">[Nebelhain](#Nebelhain)</font> was created from the rock fall. This led to the inter-tribal ban of black powder in dwarven cities, even today many dwarves are overcome with a shiver at the sight of larger quantities of black powder.

## The society of the race

This now antisocial and cold-hearted little race suffers from an enormous greed problem - money and resources are everything to the dwarves. None of it is shared altruistically under any circumstances. Dwarf mothers would starve their own children to death if they had legitimate reasons to believe that their offspring would bring more cost than benefit to the family. There are no social safeguards, no nurtured sick leave, if only the likelihood of later recouping the loss with interest. "Social" benefits you get if you don't pay for them out of your own pocket.  

This goes so far that a felon, who cannot be deterred with horrendous fines, is threatened with immediate death instead of a prison sentence. Objections that delinquents could also be sent into exile are shot down with the argument that important craft information could be passed on to other dwarf clans, which in the course of this would then profit more from their own innovations than they would themselves. To this day, such treachery is the greatest fear known to the dwarven psyche. The offshoots of this paranoia show themselves in sometimes blatantly high "safeguards" on the part of business partners.

Despite the constant competition among the dwarves of a clan, this does not mean that they would permanently sabotage each other. Rather, each dwarf is aware of the competition, but also knows that they can only earn a lot together, because both the true fortune and the true competition lies in the upper world. After all, a clan is often chained together for better or worse to create complex pieces of work, food, or even constructs.

### Clans

![The Dwarf City of Tendar[^ButteredbapNiagaraFalls]](Pictures/Flavor/Dwarves/DwarfCityUberird_butteredbap.jpg)




![A Dwarf Deep City](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/DwarfDeepCity.jpg)

Dwarven clans should not be confused with loving family groups of humans. Far more accurate is the comparison to the military arm of the empire. So one should rather think of huge corporations. This does not mean that everyone is pulling in the same direction, but that competition from other clans is even more hateful than the mining neighbor.

The position in the social hierarchy in the dwarven world is made up of crafting skills and a dwarf's wealth - though the two are often closely correlated. Thus, in theory, dwarven society is much more open to the advancement of the individual than human kingdoms would be. Usually, however, it remains a minority of dwarves who have the greatest wealth.


This effect is reinforced by the fact that in case of death, a dwarf passes on his entire fortune to the family member who has the best income. It is assumed that this family member can increase the fortune best. At the same time, this tradition is one of the reasons why some dwarfs, who are considered unproductive, are excluded from the family or sold at a young age. Less competition for the inheritance.  

The dwarven family structure is interesting anyway, as even married couples would not share resources under any circumstances. They keep separate accounts, charge each other for niceties, and charge their own children for every expense from birth - which is why most dwarves start their working lives with a small mountain of debt.  Many dwarven women also pawn or sell their children to various businesses or even to create construct cores- where the children can be killed.

In the end, however, every sensible dwarf is interested in the success of his clan, which every dwarf knows - other peoples cannot stand dwarves - and only together do you prevent hordes of humans from enriching themselves with the more or less hard-earned riches.
For this purpose a clan chief is elected. This is usually the dwarf with the most wealth, as it is assumed that he has the most to lose if ineffective action is taken.  Usually this clan chief decides about the business policy to the outside.

### Jobs

Careers in a Dwarf's life are sometimes decided early on, as some are exiled or sold at a young age. These dwarves lose citizenship in their respective clans, but are very likely to be employed as merchants. Of course, even a dwarf without citizenship is still particularly attached to his clan and has special contacts there, but he is also welcome by other clans, at least as long as he brings profit and is not able to steal important trade secrets.

**Prospector**
The lowest possible occupation for a Dwarf. Prospectors do not have a permanent job, but are "independent contractors" who are paid according to the amount of ore mined and rarity. Of course, they have to pay for their own equipment. If you can't afford proper equipment, you can of course rent some - you just have to pay a deposit of an average half month's salary. If one cannot afford the deposit, the compassionate company will, of course, gladly accept the right to the essence of close relatives/children, etc., in order to make more valuable things out of it, including construct cores. The dream of every prospector is to save up enough money to join the ranks of craftsmen or merchants.


**Craftsman
A very prestigious profession among the mountain, after all, one of the main sources of wealth is the wealth of innovation and skills of this hardworking people. Be it the famous constructions, the revolutionary processing of rare ores or simply technical achievements, in which dwarven craftsmen no other people can match.

**Guards**
Guardians are not as prestigious as other professions. Dwarves in the secure areas of a dwarven city usually refer to Guardians as "non-supporting pillars". However, guardians are better paid than prospectors. In compensation, Guardians also live far more dangerous lives. Guardians must fend off not only dangers that threaten from the upper world, but also dangers from the deep. Fire-breathing lime worms, which hunt stone worms that burrow through the interior of the mountains. Both of these have claimed many dwarven lives, but also offer an opportunity for advancement for the Guardians due to the high quality and profitable materials obtained from them. So it often happens that especially indebted dwarves carry out daring attacks to free themselves from debts as Lindwurmerleger, up to a certain amount of course.


**Dealer**
Both above and below the mountain, dwarves are notorious hagglers, who will deal with a begging grandmother with the same business harshness as they would with an uppity nobleman.

> "I once watched a Dwarf convince an Animali to become his bodyguard for a handful of reiks and still give away 80% of his earnings. I think the dwarves are just all the same."
>
> --- Mikaeus Radoban, host

**Essence Hunter
Lesser known among the other races, but essential for the production of artifacts and constructs. With their access to many souls, the Upperworld Dwarves are the most important source of essences. This profession is rarely practiced exclusively and is usually considered more of a sideline. Be it mercenaries who secure the privilege of the corpses of their enemies as part of their contract, or traveling merchants who make short work of brigands anyway.

The special thing about essence hunters is that they could even bring the bad reputation of dwarves to a lower level. Dwarves collect essences directly from the freshly dead. Special devices allow what priests call "soul-sucking".
As a result, dwarves are usually present on battlefields before a battle takes place. This has led the local populace and soldiers to refer to these essence hunters as "messengers of death" - too often the small figures are seen before a slaughter, too often running through the masses of the dead.
In the process, the dwarves do not shy away from bribing officers or clergymen. For both sides a lucrative business. After all, who can understand where soldiers flee to during a battle? Wild animals would also eat some carcasses anyway.

The rest of their bad reputation dwarves do with buying corpses from robbers, after they have taken their victims also their most valuable asset - their lives.

### Race relations

While most races know dwarves only as traveling merchants or in and around their residences in the marketplace, the Rahkari maintain a special trade with what is believed to be the oldest race. The Rahkari use as one of their main defense strategies the constructs they get from the dwarves.

Relations with the Empire have almost completely ceased since the accusation that the Empire is a carouser. The Empire continues to deny these accusations.

Relations with the orcs vary greatly depending on the clan and tribe. Some are recruited as mountain guides, others eat dwarves, and still others give them gems for very little dwarven steel.

There are no formal relations with the goblins, as there are with the orcs, due to the lack of more relevant structures on the goblin side.

The relationship with the Halflings is, in general, good. Dwarves can manage food surpluses from Yondalla very effectively and thus make more profit for both sides. Since the annexation of Yondalla by the Empire, the influence, especially from the dwarves from Vandia and the fall of Vandia has been reduced to a shadow of former size.

![A Rare Construct](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/RareConstruct.jpg)

## The religion of the race

Almost every dwarf is animated by only two thoughts, the accumulation and holding of wealth. Of course, dwarves also often deknen to their achievements and thank themselves after work done with Balbo brew.
> Material things, which is also considered as fortune, is the one and only thing. "The all-money rules the world"
> "The more fortune a dwarf possesses or the more successful his business the more fortune shines on this son of the All-money."
> - two popular dwarf sayings.


Since gathering essence is obligatory for the most powerful and profitable achievement of the dwarves, the constructs, it has mutated into a religious rite.
The "clergy" of the dwarves preach in a strict sense nothing else than collecting essences and thus protecting these poor souls from the traps of the burning lands. However, every dwarf knows that the poor souls part is just an attempt to back dwarven essence hunters into a better light.
According to the dwarves, the Burning Lands lie behind the Night Mountains, where mad gods torture all unworthy souls and make them suffer pain forever.

Among scholars, the opinion is unanimous: it is a campaign to improve the image of dwarves.
Thus, among some peoples, the rumor arose that dwarves delight in bloodshed and see corpses as offerings to their mischief gods, hoping to be rewarded by this.
Dwarves rarely see reasons to dispel these rumors, fearing that the truth would be worse received or worse - they would have to share their profits from it.
The term essence instead of soul was coined for these reasons.


### Cult of the Dead

The soul, like everything else, is just another means to get money. By burning sentient beings with a special oil, their souls can be harvested these are then used to make construct cores. However, dwarves do not talk about souls, only essences, as they do not believe in the existence of a soul or life after death.
The burning of undead, as well as that of monsters, does not grant essences, as they no longer possess a True Soul.

## The Legends of the Race

Every young dwarf knows the stories that all races tell among themselves. However, dwarves are quickly taught that anyone who tells a story is trying to sell something. Thus, the lyrical outpourings of dwarves, apart from advertising for goods or companies are very limited.  After all, this story does not bring money.
This may seem surprising, since stories are the blood that runs through the veins of the great realms, binding them together and giving everyone a common vision. Dwarves do not need this because of their materialistic worldview. Their "faith" is lived every day by all. Success, efficiency, economy and wealth can be lived. Legends cannot.

## The proper terms of the race

**Youngblood** refers to first generation dwarves living outside of the mountain.
**Supportless Pillar** derogatorily refers to the guards in dwarven towns
** Shit Digger ** denotes young digger dwarves who can only shovel stone worm excrement.


## caravans
It is in the nature of dwarves to act and in the nature of logic that a group is safer than the individual. Accordingly, it was obvious to travel in caravans, but due to the strong competitive thinking and the unwillingness to subordinate, after all, you could be disadvantaged in a deal, there are only a few pure dwarven caravans. These few travel in different sizes, but most are even equipped with large transport constructs. For other upper world dwarves, however, it is also common to join caravans of others.

## Constructs

These marvels of mechanical craftsmanship represent the zenith of dwarven innovation. Due to their religious beliefs, they are supposedly the only people capable of bringing these colossi, some of which weigh tons, to life. The constructs exist in all shapes and colors and cover every possible field of work. For example, they are one of the most powerful parts of the Rahkari army, are used by dwarven caravans to transport goods weighing tons and can also be equipped with heavy ballistae. Almost any activity that a construct performs could just as easily be done by an animal, a simple mechanism, or just a person. But constructs offer, among many other benefits, one particular advantage invaluable to dwarves - unconditional loyalty.

### Control over constructs

No construct will willingly betray its master, for they are in want of that very master. Who can give orders to a construct is clearly regulated by a so-called master stone, which is created together with the construct core and receives a purely random and unique pattern. This pattern is in resonance with the core, which carries the same pattern. The range of this resonance is limited, but within this range the construct executes any command given by the owner of the master stone, this command does not have to be said aloud, an explicit thought is already enough for this, but this requires some practice, which is why many users prefer to give the construct acoustic commands. As important as the range is, as a master you shouldn't worry so much about it, if a construct leaves the range the construct will finish going through the current action instruction. Then the construct automatically starts a previously determined "AFK Routine" the "Out of Leadership Range of the Construct Master Routine". The master stone, despite its name, can have many forms, since the pattern is imprinted only during the creation of the core. Possible masterstones would be, for example, an amulet, bracelet or actually a decorated stone, or in very rare cases, masters of their craft can even apply the pattern to the skin as a tattoo. Such tattoos bring advantages as well as disadvantages, so it is virtually impossible to transfer control over the construct in return, however, it is also virtually impossible to steal the master stone from its owner, so this is used only by the most suspicious dwarves - it lowers the resale value. Note that the use of constructs per master is limited because too many master stones under one master interfere with each other's resonance.


#### Vehicle skill for control


### The variety of possibilities

Constructs differ in many ways. Basically, the only limits are set by the craftsmanship and creativity of its builder.
Starting with the **construct core**, this heart of every construct determines the later application areas of a construct, because in contrast to other parts of the construct, it cannot be changed later. The core is not directly imprinted with its task, but rather represents the possible memory and the energy source, the better the core, the more and complicated commands the later construct can execute. Even independently string together several functions to successfully execute the command. Construct cores generally differ in their size and their purity, generally the larger a core is the more absorbent it is, but it also requires correspondingly more essences, should the space available for the core be limited there would be another dial that can be operated - the purity. This allows to reduce a core with the same absorption capacity, but this process requires significantly more essence and is probably also more error-prone.
Furthermore, there are differences in the armor. As one can well imagine, a "being" that already consists almost exclusively of metals due to its nature is already well armored, which inevitably leads to a high robustness. The parts of the inner workings of the constructs are easily destroyed due to their delicate and precise structure. This is often prevented by additional armor on the vulnerable parts of the construct. However, this also increases the weight and price.
Besides these features, there are of course two obvious ones, the equipment and the basic structure. The equipment is decisive for which tasks can be done by the construct at all and this is further supported by the structure of the construct.

### Construct types

Basically, constructs are sorted into five classes.

#### Everyday helps:

Constructs of this class are mainly found in rich dwarven households. They fulfill purposes that an employee could have done, but are much more discreet about the owner's quirks. Tasks range from manual tasks, such as the construction and maintenance of buildings, to administrative tasks. In general, they serve to improve the quality of life. The cores used are usually not very large and also not very pure. They are the expression of pure decadence and reliance on technology and knowledge.
![Constructs are not only useful on the battlefield - they can also be used as helpers in everyday life](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/ConstructLibrary.jpg)

#### Transportation:

Both above and below ground, larger quantities of goods or large loads often need to be moved. There are all kinds of ways to do this. The best one is, of course, again a construct. Here's an example: Where would you rather store your cash, in a saddlebag of an animal already known for its stubbornness and unwillingness, or in the safe inside your Loyal Companion who would follow you, without hesitation, into the Wormfall?
This class of constructs differs greatly in their designs, although they all have the same goal. The decisive factor is, of course, the payload. The number of legs or the speed are rather secondary.
These constructs are often used by surface dwarven caravans, in them everything from mystical beasts to gems can be safely transported. Often they are equipped with weapons that can be used by the crew, in addition to useful features such as padded seats.

![Equipped Transport Construct](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Construct_Transport.jpg)

#### Combat:

> I thought after years on all the battlefields I had seen it all, but when my boys were torn apart by these four-armed devils a shiver ran down my spine. No sugar came over this behemoth when old Joshua hit it with the warhammer, and none when it tore him in half.
>
>--- Abiter Kox mercenary captain on an advance against the Rahkari

Nothing is more efficient on a battlefield than a melee construct with the simple order to kill the enemy. Everyone knows that man is never more creative than in war. The effective destruction of others seems to inspire creativity. Nothing is more efficient than a construct for this task. The armor often seems impenetrable to many enemies, but no sooner are you broken through that armor are most constructs very fragile, but this already represents a mammoth task. As hard as the fight against them is, the reward can also be impressive, if the construct core remains undamaged and the master stone is obtained, both can be sold to dwarf clans at a high price, even without the construct, since these are reusable - so long as a construct with identical function is created again.

a construct - created for battle](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/ConstructBattlefield.jpg)

A ranged construct is far less adapted for close combat but not to be underestimated. It is much slower, but still powerful enough to put the fear of God into Orcs without any problems. Equipped with ballistae or crossbows, constructs are deadly even at long range. It should be noted that ranged combat requires significantly more resources from the construct core than melee combat. Due to the fact that both melee maneuvers and the complex reloading of the bolts in cooperation with people running around the construct, this simply results in a higher complexity.

![BattleConstruct](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/BattleConstruct.jpg)

![Ranged Construct](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Construct_Ballista.jpg)

#### Ornate Warrior:

These constructs are basically just combat constructs however not to be compared with the conventional ones, their smoothness and fluid movements with no loss in their strength. The cores of these constructs are significantly larger and also purer than their far more common relatives. The higher capacities allow more precise movement sequences to be programmed and even give the constructs a sort of "feel" for tactics to adapt to the current combat situation.

The best known example of the use of this class are the temple guards of the Rah Kari.


#### Titan class construct:
 
This class is the rarest of it only a handful of models exist even in the records. These partly huge creations carry cores of unbelievable dimensions and immense purity. One does not want to imagine how much essence must have flowed into the creation of such a core. Probably whole peoples were erased from the face of the earth. What makes these constructs so dangerous is not primarily their size, striking power or "intelligence" of which everything is available in masses, but much more the endurance. Any military strategist knows that constructs are dangerous but can also be destroyed if their armor is penetrated. This may be true here as well, but the crafty inventors have found a solution for this. The constructs are inhabited by many small constructs, all programmed with only one permanent command to repair the titanium class construct. But even these need cores of great purity due to their small size, although capacity is saved by the permanent installation of the command, it is still highly complex and always requires several steps. Thus one fights here a whole "swarm" of constructs. Inside, there are entire spare parts warehouses. If a part of the shoulder is shot away by a large cannon, then, according to dwarf builders, this should be automatically replaced within a few minutes.
It is difficult to distinguish between dwarven advertising and rahkar propaganda. Too rare are these sons of technology. The empire considers the capabilities exaggerated and in the price-performance ratio, the "mass production" of regular combat constructs are a bigger problem.

### Construction

What powers these constructs is a so-called construct core. These exist in various sizes and purities and are created with the help of the souls of sentient beings. The larger and purer the more essence is needed. From these "adjusting screws" the later "intelligence" of the constructs depends, since these determine quasi the quantity of learnable behavior patterns. In less serious buzzed evenings of scholars it is rumored that the purest and largest cores can develop a consciousness, as there must not necessarily be a difference to a, so far not found, human soul. Officially, neither dwarves nor Rahkari speak of it.

To get the souls for the expensive creation of constructs, there is a special tool for surface dwarves - the soul catcher - in the process of capturing the souls the bodies have to be burned. This is not a problem in a dwarven city with a volcano or a forge, but it is rather difficult to do on the road. Therefore, the soul catcher comes with a vial filled with a highly combustible special oil for quick cremation of corpses. This oil is extracted from enzymes of the lime worm's fire organ, and it produces a steady supply of new oil for a relatively long time after the lime worm's demise, provided a secret formula is constantly replenished. However, the fire organs are also consumed over time, which means that there is a constant demand for lindworm innards.

![The Forges of the Dwarves](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/DwarfForge2.jpg)

## The thunder guards

Thunder Guardians represent a small faction among the dwarves who believe in the ancient dark horror that is locked in the depths and will eventually burst to the surface to wreak havoc on the world. They owe their name, according to their own statement, to the old days when thunder could still be heard in the depths, but it has been silenced for centuries and no dwarf knows exactly where in the mountains it was heard at all. The members are close to fanaticism, so some even spend some time a day in the city trying to spread the word instead of spending their time on profitable activities. There are rumors in the higher society that an execution of these do-nothings would be appropriate. So far, however, it has not happened, because there are also hardworking members in higher positions.
The members of this faction are marked with a special and complicated tattoo, which are very reminiscent of the resonance circuits of a construct tattoo.

There are rumors that this tattoo is still able to open those hidden dwarven vaults still from the time of the old dwarves, before the revolution.
Moreover, the constructs in Vandia seem to leave owners of these masks alone.

Since parts of the Thunder Guard culture derive from the formerly prevalent mentality of "shared wealth," these dwarves accordingly have a somewhat different approach to their religion of all-money. As with normal dwarves, they are also concerned with gaining more, be it wealth or power, but this does not necessarily have to be for them alone. Much more, everything is subordinated to a larger goal or to serve the great majority.

The dwarves as probably the oldest of all races are accordingly older than all other religions, but this knowledge has only been preserved by the Thunder Guardians, because in their sagas it is still described that they had received their order from an old powerful creature. When this was overthrown by similar creatures, their people fell into madness.

In the time of the downfall, many doomed Thunder Guardians hid their treasures and sealed them with the Thunder Guardian seal, so that Thunder Guardians themselves could at least support the rebuilding of their grouping in the future. These vaults and fortress-like hiding places are also said to contain strategic information about other Thunder Guard branches.

In the general understanding of the current dwarven history, this part of the story is considered as a failed action to increase the prestige of the Thunder Guard faction. After all, no faction voluntarily calls itself crazy. Also, solid evidence for these stories is still lacking. Even with the best of intentions, scholars have not been able to establish more than hearsay. It is more obvious to send gullible adventurers into highly dangerous dwarven ruins, or even to let them drown in the eternal bloodbath of Vandia.

The Inqusition of the Doctrine of the Allgod, sees in the Thunder Guardians rather madmen and financially ruined dwarves, who have devoted themselves to the blood god "Saath Valar". Due to possible technological relevance, Thunder Guardians may be hanged for blasphemy, if they do not live out their "faith" too publicly, but they may very well be imprisoned. This decree of the emperor "to preserve the dwarven cultures" is grudgingly tolerated by the Inquisition.



##Remains of the dwarven wedding in the upper world


During the time of the Fall, both factions tried to hide and secure as much treasure as possible from the other. Thus, hidden treasuries were built all over the continent, but which dwarf would leave his treasures unguarded? These facilities, some of which eat deep into the earth, are usually heavily guarded. Be it by traps or even constructs. This triggered a time of adventure and unexpected riches in all peoples following the fall of the united dwarven kingdom, when word of these hideouts spread. Over the years, some chambers fell into disrepair, others were declared home by monsters or by goblins.
Even today, adventurous dwarves leave the realms beneath the mountains to seek riches from these legendary vaults, and the other races had also begun their search. According to the Thunder Guardians, however, these adventurers will never be able to enter the Thunder Guardians' chambers, for their greatest treasures are revealed only to Thunder Guardians. But as word spread, the hunt for these same heirs began in the upper world as well. But the fewer the guardians and the chambers became, the more this knowledge was forgotten. Today, only a few know about the stories of these Thunder Guardians.

Some vaults in Eldria, due to ancient relations with the dwarves, are in a special position. So even today some nobles protect these locked chambers, even if they have already forgotten for whom and why they actually protect them. Other nobles build estates and vacation domiciles on them because they consider it a kind of status symbol. This is due to the fact that traditions hardly die in Eldria.

## Known dwarves in the upper world

**Baruuk Leader of the Groll Mercenary Corps** a living legend among Upperworld dwarves, known for his creativity, business acumen, and bravery in battle.
This well-known mercenary troop, which consists exclusively of dwarves, usually works in small groups of 3-4 men, always equipped with long-range weapons, mostly muskets or crossbows. What makes this troop special are the small helpers of the troop, each member of the troop carries a construct with him. These constructs are a serial production as far as it is possible - basically it is a rather small construct core without any relevant purity, this is in a steel ball about the size of a head. The locomotion is done with the help of 3 legs, which are connected to the sphere by a very strong spring. This self-tensioning spring serves the main purpose of the construct the powerful catapulting of itself. This serves the long-distance fighters to protect themselves from unpleasant acquaintances at close range.

> The damage these darlings do may not be great, but ever get a 50kg steel ball under your chin, against your knee or into your gems? There is no man who does not stumble!
> --- Baruuk about his constructs

The time bought by the constructs knowledge the skillful shooters always use well, this explains the extraordinarily high success rate of the troops. This strategy would not be of great value in big battles, but for defense against small groups of raiders it is perfect. Every dwarf who wants to be part of the group has to buy in and in return receives one of these constructs but also pledges allegiance to the Corps. As a pledge, sufficiently well-heeled dwarves take over the entire ab and Gut.

Baruuk who himself is only part of a small dwarf clan holds a patent on these small constructs together with his clan.
