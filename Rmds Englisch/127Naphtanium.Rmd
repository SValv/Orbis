#The Naphtanium region

![Map of Napthanium](Pictures/Maps/Napthanium.jpg)

Until 2 decades ago, the Naphtanium region was still a part of the Upper Reik, forming a buffer region from the tundras of the Ice Country.
Officially, the reason for the separation of this part of the Upper Reik is listed with bureaucratic reasons, since the paved connecting roads to the Upper Reik only run through the Heartland (since about 3 decades) Defacto, however, there was still a paved connecting road at the southern edges of the Sable Forest about 3 decades ago.
This was destroyed over several kilometers by a large mudslide in 394 AD.
However, the then regional commander of the Oberreik offered to repair it, but this never happened.
The reasons for this are equally speculative.
Poor coffers, attacks by elves or rumors of malicious beings or the intervention of the emperor himself are discussed in private.
An official letter was mentioned as the reason for the refusal of the road repair and the resulting detour via the heartland, for which in Oberreik minor penalties were due.

For the Heartland and the juggernaut called Civis Primae, this brought an indirect advantage, since the coveted ironwood from the sable forest, as well as the agricultural goods could be brought more cheaply and safely to the Heartland.

As regional commander in Naphtanium, which was named after the "black city" Naphtanium, Hadranius Maximus Woranius was appointed, who since then administers the territories and seems to be loyal to the emperor.
Hadranius Maximus Woranius himself does not reside in Naphtanium, but in Lignium, where he officially supports the bureaucrats of the Heartland in breaking up the criminal structures.

Naphtanium itself is geographically isolated in relation to other major cities in the regions.
Regardless of this, many soldiers are explicitly stationed there to, according to official positions, protect them from attacks of the Animali, with which, however, especially at night, is traded on the streets.

The main products are officially, wood, horses, coal, black fat, pitch, sulfur mining and sugar maple and a marginal agricultural surplus, because the regional capital Naphtanium itself is almost completely dependent on food supplies.

## Localities of the region

### Naphtanium

Through the clearing of the last large forests north of Civis-Primae, the access behind the swamps of Lignium there were found black grease (pitch-black oily substance for smearing and use in candles and oils), pitch and sulfur.
This and occasional trade relations with the Animali and a large donation from the Imperial Army made it possible to establish an alchemy school in these cold-wet areas bordering the tundras of the north, which is now closed to the public.
Rumor has it that this school is involved in the research of several alchemical wonders.
Naphatanium is completely dependent on food supplies and is often described as a black city.

Population: 67,000

### White City

Sulfur mining, beginning copper and lead mining

White City is located on the extreme border of the Naphatanium region and, like the black city of Naphatnium itself, on Mount Ice View.
Was first used only as a mining town for sulfur mining, but grew significantly and is the little twin of Naphtanium.

Population: 7,300

### Lignium

Timber construction, horse keeping & breeding, wood craft, coal mining, sugar maple

Once surrounded by dense forest areas, most of it was deforested over the rise of the Empire, which also provided access to the tundras of the north.
Rampant corruption and high crime rate.

For the past 10 years, administered by bureaucrats directly ordered by the emperor and high-ranking representatives of the ecclesia.

Population: 120,000

### Great Forest Hack

Timber trade, timber industry, horse breeding, grazing livestock & phosphorus mines

Logging of forest led to exposure of Reichsintern phosphorus mines.
Degradation of phosphorus in recent years sharply declining.

Population: 7000

### Small forest hack

Timber industry, sugar maple

Forestry settlement that supplies hardwood and natural sugar maple to Civis-Primae via Great Forest Hack and Great Tantum.
Has a military outpost which protects from werewolves, cathakans and flesh sucker attacks.

Population: 2500

### Jash-Hurk

Gems

Orc settlement near the black city of Naphtanium.
Orcs are recruited for the ranks of the Imperial Armies and otherwise live off the tundras and hunting.
Ritual contests and carnal-lustful orgies and occasional skirmishes with the Animali of the Ice Country make up the bulk of their lives.

Population: about 8,000

### Infrastructure

Regions such as Nors or the Heartland have a well-developed infrastructure, as it is the artery through which the Empire can move its wealth and military strength.

In the Naphtanium region, however, the development is much worse. Besides the road leading to the logging area in the Sable Forest, only the road to the black city of Naphtanium is passable most of the year.
The ideally moderately functioning administration in the Naphtanium region, for example, has not been able to repair a connecting road between the Upper Reik region and Naphtanium for years.
However, since Naphtanium has no relevant cities to develop besides the juggernaut Lignium and the city of Naphatnium, the rest of the road network is poorly developed.
Despite the mediocre infrastructure, travelers are probably less likely to be ambushed by elves than in the other regions. While there are occasional bandit ambushes, they rarely involve any sort of organized gang activity. The danger is more likely to occur when traveling to more isolated regions such as the border of the Ice Country, as not all Animali are friendly, and some vile ones like to consume humans.

A peculiarity is the road towards the city of Naphtanium, where it is surprisingly common to find traveling alchemists to take advantage of the city's reputation and sell their, effective or useless products.
One of the few roads leading a few kilometers into the Ice Country passes by Naphtanium and then several kilometers further into the Cave of Roslos <font color="green">[the Cave of Roslos](#Roslos)</font>, which is one of the few trading outposts of the Animali.


## The history of the region

The region was historically tied to the Upper Reik, and had only become habitable due primarily to the massive timber needs of the growing Heartland when resident elven tribes were driven out piece by piece.

The elven tribes were also relocated in the course of the uprooting, and many of these city elves now eke out an existence in Civis Primae or Lignium itself.
One of the central points of history in this ex-region of Oberreik is the Battle of Valenfels.
There the elven tribes had tried to gather to fight together against the deforestation of their forests.
Despite the location, which at the time was several kilometers from the forest line, the Imperial Army got wind of it.

Thereupon an entourage of orcs of the Jash-Hurk tribe, drugged with combat drugs, was sent there.
Taken by surprise, to say the least, the elves were attacked there and succumbed to the group of several hundred orcs clad in steel armor.
It was a brutal slaughter and, according to the Empire, not a single elf escaped the slaughter.
Since then, for elves and orcs, as well as for the Empire, valerization is the epitome of overwhelming merciless victory.

The elven fighting spirit was broken and the intoxicated orcs wandering through the forests caused so much panic among the elves that they surrendered even to massively outnumbered scouting troops of the regular imperial army.

The incorporation of these wood elves into the cities of the empire marked one of the many bloody climaxes in the uprooting.

The organization of this campaign was taken over by a trio of dwarves, who were promised to weigh their weight and that of all their children in gold.
This 40 year plan cost the empire a fortune.
Allegedly, the trio of dwarves fed the orc tribe for over 2 decades to get a huge force of soldiers.
The use of combat drugs was also long tested and planned.

In return, the dwarf trio did not want to be named and in return they wanted to administer lands as "princes".
In the decades that followed, however, only one city, which burned down in 244 n.
Riga burned down, which was administered by a dwarf dynasty.

The following centuries passed without any problems for the people.
Emperors came and died, but the forest continued to be cut down.
Even centuries later, the elves had not been able to muster the strength or courage to rebel against the empire again.

The tradition of positioning orcs of the Jash-Hurk tribe in steel armor at the edges of the forests in the region of Oberreik, nowadays Naphtanium, is considered to be one of the reasons for this.
Allegedly the anniversary of the massacre.

Skirmishes with the elves were a daily problem until a few centuries ago, but today they are no longer a threat to stability away from the larger forests.
The services of Cirion Demian, who was the First Stadtholder of Lignium, are to thank for the area's rapid rise as the "Sawmill of Mankind".
Cirion began sending lumberjacks to the areas on the same evening of the Valenfels victory.
Likewise, already 4 weeks later, most of the guildless strong workers were in the Naphtanium region to cut wood.
It was a business which was impossible to lose.
The coffers in the region, especially in Lignium were bulging.
Many talented craftsmen also came from this region to work with ironwood.
The local orc settlement "Jash-Hurk" of the "Jash-Hurk" tribe has not been in any relevant conflicts with the Empire since the massacre, but has historically long standing feuds with the Animali of the Ice Country, which are less successful.

Lignium itself, thanks to its wealth from the sale of wood and wood crafts, could afford a number of amenities that were difficult to obtain in most regions.
Thus, down comforters, soft mattresses and a full stomach could be seen through all social classes.
However, the fame of money blinded people to the dangers of sable rot, as well as that of monopolizing a single industry.

About 120 years ago, the economic decline of Lignium and the Naphtanium region began.
Heavy rains destroyed several crops and suddenly made the transportation of heavy ironwood impossible.
The cold-wet summers around 306 to 310 n.
Riga also intensified the problems with sable rot.
The once bulging coffers emptied rapidly, and the high standard of living would not be abandoned by anyone.
Even after 310 n.
Riga, the situation hardly improved, since the demand for ironwood seemed to be saturated on the one hand, and on the other hand, production was more effective on the other side of the sable forest in today's Upper Reik region.
The mismanagement in Lignium, which at that time represented about two-thirds of the economic output in today's Naphtanium, was continuously shrinking.
A ruling noble family, which was known more for its pompousness than for its knowledge of numbers, only accelerated the decline.

The remnants of the once huge pie were no longer divided according to the jurisdictions, but to the best bidder, or the friend of a friend.
Neither could the nobility put an end to the friend economy, nor put a stop to moral decay.

\
*"I tell you, the decay of Lignium lies with the moral decay of the people. When was the last time you, dear believers, saw someone from Lignium in the houses of worship? You can meet men there more often in brothels and gambling than in the places where the soul is kept! The outgrowth of this immoral decadence is Naphtanium. A godless black city, where behind closed doors the evil itself is created! Therefore, my gathered here, get away from Naphtanium, get away from these godless, lost souls, lest the same happens to you!

*Preserver of the central resting place of Agiontium 424 n. Riga*

## Economic situation

Naphtanium, considered as a region, does not have a particularly strong economy. Besides depending on food supplies for better food, Naphtanium is plagued by corruption.

The few relevant resources are ironwood and its products from the sable forest and the ominous black grease from Naphtanium.
From the empire's capital, Civis Primae, the cities of White City and Naphtanium are supported. This means both that there are significantly more imperial soldiers present and that there is significantly more bustle than is usual for such cities.
Lignium itself, as the largest city in Naphtanium, is struggling with rampant corruption, so it is not exactly clear how much of the Empire's money is sinking into the many and deep pockets of the inhabitants there without fulfilling its declared purposes.

The standard of living in the region is mediocre at best, despite the theoretically lucrative sale of ironwood and financial support from Civis Primae. Malicious tongues claim that the region is relatively safe, but only because the greedy and evil have already lined their pockets. There are rumors in Civis Primae that the region will be destabilized as soon as the money and the imperial army withdraw from the region. The ulterior motive is supposedly to maintain the stability of the city of Naphtanium and its great school of alchemy.


### The resources of the region

Timber, horses, coal, black grease, pitch, sulfur mining and sugar maple, alcohol, and a marginal agricultural surplus

## Sociopolitical situation

Rumors surrounding the city of Naphtanium are now reaching greater proportions. For example, representatives of the Doctrine of the All-God in Lignium believe that ungodly things are being tried in Naphtanium. For example, the deceased are said not to be buried, faith in general is questioned, and the All-God has already abandoned the entire city because of its blackness.
The alchemist school "Grenzwissen", claims in pamphlets and quorums in Civis Primae that the accusations are far-fetched.
The reaction of Civis Primae for the first decades was that the region would have to solve it itself. Wait and see and let water flow down the Reik was the motto. This did not solve any problems, however, and some alchemists from the black city of Naphtanium were declared undesirables in Lignium.
The newly appointed administrator in Lignium, tried to abolish these declarations, but failed due to the resistance of the local clergy.
Indirect allusions of the emperor to corruption were the threat of withdrawal of funds for support, as well as less autonomy for the region.

The rhetorical trench warfare between the Black City and Lignium meant that Lignium now stood alone in the political tussle. Lignium has managed to use its connections to draw most of the smaller cities and the orc settlement of Jash-Hurk to its side, or at least not to support the black city.


### Ruling System/Organization

Officially enjoying the same autonomy as Oberreik, defacto the Naphatanium region is dependent on the favor of the rulers in Civis Primae.
Current legal head: Hadranius Maximus Woranius

The Black City of Naphatanium and White City are legally a special protectorate of the Emperor.

Religion: All-God Faith

## Climatic conditions

In general, the region can be described as cold-humid. Harvests of wheat or oats are usually heavily infested with black fungus. Thus, rain and snow showers are frequent, which has earned Naphtanium the title of "The Emperor's Pisspot." Summers are usually dry, which forces the transport of heavy ironwood during these months.


### The flora and fauna

Apart from the peculiarities of the sable forest, the flora and fauna are relatively similar to those of the Heartland and Upper Reik. Forests are mainly composed of deciduous trees, further north these are replaced by conifers such as the Imperial Spruce.

#### Monsters in the region

The classic ineradicable werewolves and cathakans represent the most frequently encountered monsters. More rarely, representatives of the hellspawn are reported, which are often hunted by Animali tribes.

## Rumors of the region

### The founding

The explanation for the founding of the Special Administrative Region is speculative. The rumor mill ranges from insulting nonsense such as that one of the emperor's mistresses was an excellent alchemist, who was then subordinated to the city of Naphtanium, to simple goodwill towards the corrupt authorities in Lignium in order to show who has the say in the empire.

### The Dark Master

In the black heart, deep in the winding alleys of Naphtanium, there is said to be a woman who will grant your every wish. She is described in the streets of Naphtanium as "the dark mistress". Thus, failed people come to her, or are found by her, and the victims promise themselves a better, more dignified life.
In return, the unfortunate victims have to endure experiments, supposedly with black fat. According to the rumors, however, these are to be described as blasphemous, heretical or simply insane, so that the alchemist school in Naphtanium had a statement announced, according to which the school would never approve of such experiments.
After the experiments, the victims are supposed to actually live a better life for a few years until they are led back to the realm of the All-God under dubious circumstances.


### The Green Guardian of Lignium

Almost every child in the city knows that Lignium is rife with corruption. After all, fathers and mothers can only get appointments with healers or local representatives in exchange for a chunk of reiks or favors. There have been repeated uprisings of the population, but these have not led to any changes; the slime of corruption seems to flow in everywhere. That changed half a decade ago when someone chained a corrupt resting place keeper naked to a pole.
Although at first it was rumored that this was simply someone who did not belong to his superiors, later people were always paraded like this. In the beginning, it was attributed to an angry Animali who came from the Ice Country to take revenge. But besides the "naked chains" as it was called in Lignium, drug dealers, thugs or enforcers were also partly executed.

The biggest coup, however, was achieved by the green guard when he prevented a shipment of ironwood to Eldria, which was not approved by the Empire. In the ironwood, several weapons were found, including a large number of Moltovika of excellent quality. This led to the case of a pus-bearer in Lignium named Magnus Lutorius who was then imprisoned and spent 1 year in prison.

However, Magnus Lutorius was then released from prison on the grounds of "nullity of the accusation" and he received 50,000 reiks compensation from Lignium.
After that, the trace of the green guard was lost and the practice of "chaining naked" has since been punished as an insult to honor with a much higher sentence in Lignium.


## Sights

### The bronze statue of Hadranius Maximus Woranius

If you are on the direct route to Lignium from Civis Primae, you will see a five meter high bronze statue of Hadranius Maximus Woranius on a granite rock at the gates of the city. Hadranius, the city administrator by imperial grace, has been trying since his arrival to take over Lignium and all of Naphtanium and finally get rid of the slime of corruption.

For his efforts, he is said to have placed this gift in the form of a masterfully crafted bronze statue with eyes made of opals one night.


### Bachpachnie Street

The road leading into the Black City, located outside the locked gates of Naphtanium, is called Bachpachnie Street. Usually the place where the undesirable faces gather before Naphtanium to profit from the reputation of the alchemy school, it is also the place where an alchemy contest is held every year. Winners of it can commit themselves to live and work in the city for 10 years with much more freedom than in the rest of the civilized empire.

The common people, who are not quite inclined to faith, see this as proof of the technical and intellectual superiority of the Empire. More pragmatic spirits see it as a way to get hold of vapors of the knowledge of Naphtanium, mixed with a portion of rare ingredients that the Animali trade there.
In the few local bakeries, a baking festival also takes place in the summer. There, the confectioners vie for the favor of lucrative orders in Naphtanium. The tasting is initially private, but military representatives from the entire Naphtanium region are often invited. On several occasions, one of the emperor's sons has been on hand to indulge his sweet cravings.
