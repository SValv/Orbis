# The ice country

Iceland is a cold, barren tundra on the edge of the known world.The region is known to be dangerous for outsiders who have never experienced the harsh and cold reality of this region. Not only does the climate make it difficult to survive in this region, but there are also numerous monsters living in this region that can pose a challenge to even the best fighters. The only beings that have managed to survive in this reality are the <font color="green">[Animali](#Creatura Animali)</font>, a mysterious race of unique humanoids. They look like a mix of humans and monsters and exhibit various mutations. They are the dominant race in a region full of monsters, where only the strongest survive. Many people are attracted to this mysterious region, but few return with pleasant experiences.

## Villages of the region

Due to the deadly nature of Iceland, it is extremely difficult to establish settlements. The Empire has tried to establish some outposts in the region, but with very little success. They were repeatedly attacked by monsters, and it took a long time for the Empire and the Animali to establish a friendly relationship. Despite the nomadic nature of the Animali, they have only one place that is considered the most important place for the people. This is the cave of Khazak.

### The cave of Khazak {#The cave of Khazak}

The cave of Khazak is located in the western part of the region. The cave is the most sacred place for the animali and it is also the place where the original humans who transformed into animali originally arrived. It contains the original texts that made the animali the beings they are today, and it is also the place where the main shaman of the animali lives and communicates with their gods. The cave is also one of the few places where the different tribes gather every year. Once a year, all the tribes gather and hold a tournament to find out who will be elected as the main shaman of their people, which is considered a great honor. During this time, the Animali also celebrate and pray to their god for the past and coming year. So far, not a single human, dwarf, goblin, or elf has seen the Cave of Khazak, as the Animali are very protective of their most sacred place in the Ice Country.


### The summit of Mount Sro {#Sro}

The mountaintop of Sro was once home to a now dead but dangerous lindworm named Tramonastrus. Tramonastrus terrorized the lands around it and many Animali died from its teeth and claws. Tramonastrus caused chaos for many years, but an Animali named Roranko managed to defeat the powerful beast. Roranko was known as a clever hunter who often used his wits to defeat monsters. It was only after his brother was killed by the Lindworm that Roranko decided to fight back against the monsters. Roranko traveled to the dangerous mountain to face the beast that had killed his brother. But this mountain was also home to many other monsters, and the journey was more difficult than expected. It tested all his abilities and his body, but after many days he managed to reach the top of the mountain above the clouds. Here he set a trap for Tramonastrus and waited for his enemy to return. Using the knowledge he had acquired as a hunter and the power he had gained from his years of hunting, he made Tramonastrus fly from the top of the mountain, crash to the ground and kill him.

Although this event happened many years ago, many hunters travel to this sro to test themselves as hunters and travel up the mountain to reach the summit where Roranko faced Tramanstrus. The journey up the mountain is considered enlightening by most hunters and helps them grow as animali. It is said that during this journey a hunter learns the 4 virtues of Roranko.

Today, the peak of Sro is a destination for almost all great hunters and is considered almost like a temple by the monks of the kingdom. At the foot of the mountain there is a base camp where the hunters gather and gather before climbing the mountain. This camp is one of the few permanent settlements of the Animali. Sadly, many young Animali travel to the mountain to be recognized as great hunters, but they end up dying.


### Roslos Cave {#Roslos}

In all of Iceland, there is only one place that is considered safe for humans. This is the Cave of Roslos in the east of Iceland, which is one of the only safe places where humans can interact and trade with the Animali in Iceland. The Animali and the Empire had many conflicts when they first started dealing with each other, but through many diplomatic missions and much time spent getting to know each other, they eventually built a friendly relationship. The Empire tried to establish many outposts in Iceland, but always failed when they did so themselves. It was not until the Montrak Tribe helped a trading company called the Golden Branch that a secure trading outpost was established. The Montrak tribe invited the Golden Branch caravan to take shelter in one of the caves they used for shelter. This cave was not too far from the borders of the empire, but also not too far from the tribes of the Ice Country. This made it an ideal place for trade between the two peoples. Different Animali tribes often sought shelter in the cave, and it took some time for the different tribes to accept the presence of humans. Even today, only those people known to the tribes are allowed to stay in the cave. Nevertheless, today people use the cave as a trade center to receive goods and commodities from the animali and to sell the products from the kingdom.

### Infrastructure

Iceland does not have a significant infrastructure. The animali tribes that roam the land are all nomadic and as such do not build their own infrastructure. The Empire has attempted to build some sort of road or path to the Outpost of the Past and the Cave of Roslos, but the monsters and climate make it difficult to build or maintain any form of infrastructure.

## The history of the region

Until the <font color="green">[First Contact with the Animali](#AnimaliContactWar)</font>, the Animali were the only people who had records of the region's history, and even today the region is very poor in history compared to other parts of the world. The first records of Iceland came with the emergence of the Animali, but even today they are very protective of their records and have many secrets that they do not share with the world.

## Origin of the race

The Animali were an ordinary group of people on the run from someone or something long forgotten.
They eventually fled to the remote areas of the Ice Country, where they took shelter in the cave of Khazak.
In this cave they found texts and murals of the forerunners.
They tried to translate, interpret and understand these texts, but they failed completely.
As a result of their misunderstanding, a new religion formed, which led to their transformation into the creatures we see today and call Creatura Animali, or colloquial Animali.

### First Contact with the Empire {#AnimaliContactWar2}

That other Animali tribes exist is well known, as there are often territorial conflicts, or fights over resources.
Therefore, it is not uncommon that after a fight between two tribes, one of the tribes joins the other to prevent the extinction of one tribe.
Thus, in the world of the Animali, there were exclusively other Animali besides the monsters and animals of the Ice Land.
Occasionally there were stories about other creatures that did not belong to any of these groups, but, since Animali were often not the most advanced creatures, these stories were never believed.

One day, a few Animali of the Treprack tribe were following the trail of a large spearman when they were caught in a heavy snowstorm.
Since their eyes could no longer discern paths, they had to rely on other senses such as hearing and smelling.
During their chase, they were suddenly attacked by many, presumably smaller creatures.
What was special about this was that they seemed to be well coordinated and could talk to each other in a different language.
Confused by this unexpected attack, the Animali did not immediately know how great the danger would be that would come from this unknown group.
So, at the beginning, they decided to continue pursuing the large spearer, as they were sure that it would pose the greater threat to them and their tribe.
(how can they continue to pursue the spearer during an attack?) However, due to the noise and movements, starting from the small group, the large spearer kept changing its behavior patterns, quickly approaching and moving away from the groups.
(in battle then? - transition from pursuit to battle?) With the target firmly in sight, the Animali took advantage of every opportunity to attack the large impaler and, over time, were able to wrestle it to the ground and, with the help of the unknown creatures, defeat it without further loss.

With the death of the monster, the Animali realized great losses on the part of the unknown beings.
Were they very confused why they supported the attack on the monster and stopped the attacks on themselves.
(Da Najare, a young fighter of the Treprack Clan, who had great interest in everything outside her world of knowledge, convinced her tribesmen that these unknown beings certainly had no evil intentions towards them.
They disarmed the strange group to learn more about their weapons and way of life, but decided not to kill the unknown beings, who did not seem so dissimilar to them, contrary to the usual handling of the Animali.
Their goal was now to take one of the creatures into captivity in order to learn more about them.
Surprisingly, one of the strangers emerged more or less voluntarily from the group and went along with them.
Over time, a sort of rudimentary communication developed between the two peoples.
Najare, in all her curiosity, realized that the prisoner could be a chance for her to leave her tribe and learn more about the world outside her living environment, as her big sister had done before.
The rest of the Treprack clan countered this interest with rejection and resentment towards the prisoner.
Thus, he would bring disaster upon the clan and want to destroy it in all malice.

After learning all she could communicate from the prisoner, Najare decided to release him and arrange a repeated meeting with him.
She could not give up her desire to learn more about these beings.
So they agreed on a meeting that would take place 3 moons later at the place of the battle.

### The Great Hunt for the World Worm

> So you want to know who was the greatest monster slayer in our history? Unfortunately, I haven't gained that knowledge yet, but I can tell you about the greatest monster hunt of our time, the one that shaped our world forever.
>
> --- Jacob Lasmisimus - tells stories to the guests of the Thirsty Jug Inn

![Painting of the Worldworm by Rufus Vingilius](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Worldworm.jpg)

In the northwestern parts of the empire, it is known everywhere that the Animali produce some of the finest hunters in our world, and that it is these hunters who bring down the most terrible of monsters and beasts.
But no prey has ever come close to that of the world worm Manisiqus, hunted for more than three years.

The <font color="green">[World Worms](#WorldWorm)</font> are among the largest creatures on our world, and many scholars speculate to this day how a creature of this size is able to feed itself - let alone not collapse under its own weight.
These creatures burrow deep beneath the earth of our world and are rarely seen above ground.
Manisiquis, however, dug himself out of the ground over and over again, causing considerable damage and fear in both the Imperial Empire and Yondalla, and was also sighted in the Ice Country.
The emperor himself therefore called in 65 n.
Riga a <font color="green">[great hunt]()</font> proclaimed.

Until that time, it was believed that the Animali had not had a unified goal set by their chief shaman for 80 years.
However, soon after Manisiquis was discovered by the Rakhul tribe, the then chosen shaman Rinsimikak received a vision from the gods in which he saw the many tribes of Animali standing gloriously on the head of the slain Weltwum.
With this vision, Rinsimikak set himself the goal of reuniting the Animali and hunting the World Worm.

After many weeks and months of preparation, the Animali finally sprang into action, chasing after Manisiquis.
Although the Animali were accustomed to surviving underground and fighting the abominations of Orbis Astea, the hunting party is said to have lost 36% of its members to fighting the other creatures that lived underground.
According to the writings of the late Philip Bergsam, it is also said that the Animalus Yukak - with the mutation of the Giant Mole - was the only reason the hunting party was able to pursue Manisiquis beyond the borders of Eisland.
However, the hunters of the Empire - who had answered the call of the great hunt - were more than grateful for the Animali's competent support, as they had so far proved absolutely without a chance against the monstrosity.

![Illustration of an entrance into the caverns of a worldworm](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Worldworm-Entrance.jpg)

After 3 grueling years and many losses, the Animali finally succeeded in bringing Manisiquis to its knees in the region now known as Misty Grove by means unknown to the Empire to this day.
It was said that the Animali celebrated for 10 days without resting at the resting place of their greatest prey.
What the Animali did not realize, however, was that the cave system through which they had traveled to Misty Grove had collapsed behind them due to the onslaught of Manisiquis.
After their only known way back home was sealed, the rest of the Animali decided to colonize the area they were now in, and after a few generations, these Animli became the Lizardmen we know today.


## Economic Situation

Although Iceland shares many similarities with Misty Grove, the Animali of Iceland choose to trade regularly with their neighbors. Most Animali tribes are now familiar with the existence of the Empire and other factions and would trade with humans and other races if they encountered them in Eisland, however slim that chance may be. The Empire has attempted to establish several trade outposts in Iceland, but almost all have failed. The most successful trading outpost is located in the Cave of Roslos. Here, people trusted by the Animali, such as the Golden Branch Society, are allowed to trade with the Animali, and some Animali tribes send their people to trade in the Empire. An example of this is the Kreuzburg in Oberreik. Animali travel all the way from Eisland to the city to trade their goods with the Empire and improve their relations with the Empire.

Outside of Khazak Cave, the Animali sometimes trade with each other, though they often tend to fight over resources necessary for their survival. This conflict between the different tribes is one of the main reasons why Eisland has a very weak economy. In addition, the Animali tend not to collect ores from the various mines, and their production methods and culture keep them from producing more and new goods. However, trade with the Empire is slowly beginning to have a positive effect on the Animali and Eisland, but it remains to be seen to what extent this will affect the region.

### The Region's Resources

Eisland has very few resources due to the region's climate. Most of the land is covered in snow and ice, and the Animali do not make very good use of the resources in the ground. The Animali culture and way of life has kept them from expanding their production methods, and they are not as advanced as other factions, so they do not tend to produce surplus goods from ores.

However, there is one resource that is coveted by many in the Empire and around the world. One that Iceland has a lot of. Monster Parts. The Animali are born hunters and often trade their monster parts with the Empire. In addition, Ice Country has some rare plants and ingredients that are hard to come by elsewhere. The Animali now also trade these resources with the Empire whenever they have the opportunity, and many scholars seek these ingredients for advanced potions and alchemy.

## Sociopolitical Situation

The Animali have a very tight political intrigue due to their nomadic nature. Some tribes have rivalries with each other, but these rarely go beyond two tribes. The rivalries can sometimes become very violent and cause a tribe to become extinct, but this rarely happens. Some hunters also have rivalries among themselves that are passed on to the next generation. Nevertheless, each individual tribe fights for the right to have someone from their tribe become the chosen shaman of the Animali and reside in the cave of Khazak.

Although the Animali and the Empire have a friendly relationship, there is still much tension between them. The Animali are still very protective of their land and some people from the Empire still foolishly wander into the Ice Country and disturb the Animali. In addition, some Animali still do not fully accept the presence of the Empire in their land and sometimes clash with the humans, which further worsens the relationship between the Empire and the Animali. One could even say that the First Contact War never really ended, as some tribes still fight humans when they see them.

### Ruling System/Organization

Each Animali tribe is led by a shaman. They play a very important role in the tribes' society and act as leaders and guides of the people. Each time a shaman dies, a new shaman is elected from the ranks of the tribe. The candidates are often trained beforehand and are highly respected by the people. Above each shaman of each tribe is the chosen chief shaman, who lives in the cave of Khazak. This shaman lives in the cave of Khazak for a year and communicates with the gods and is considered the most important person among all Animali. Moreover, this shaman is elected every year during a tournament in the Khazak cave.

## Climatic conditions

Temperatures in Eisland are almost below freezing, and the region owes its name to the constant ice and snow in the region. Eisland is referred to as tundra, where hardly any plants can survive due to the temperatures and snow.

### The flora and fauna

#### Monsters in the region

The <font color="green">[Manticore](#Manticore)</font> is according to the Animali a monsterous creature that should not exist and since its birth it has plagued the animali.

## Rumors of the region

### About Mantikore {#Mantikore}

The first manticore was composed of parts of bears, bats and scorpions together.

A manticore is a creature originally created by the beast tamer Rakrak of the Rikika tribe.
Long ago, Rakrak was tasked with finding a way for the tribe to win the annual "Old Ancestors" contest, as his tribe was looked down upon for not winning the contest in over a hundred years.

Rakrak asked the gods for guidance and was told to travel to the Heartland.
Shortly thereafter, Rakrak left his tribe, leaving his apprentice in charge of affairs, which inevitably led to the tribe's demise.
Even today, the tribe is but a shadow of its former self.
During the first months of his journey, Rakrak came up with the idea of adding another mutation to an Animali to further improve its fighting ability.

Many years passed, and Rakrak rigorously continued his research into further mutation.
Slowly, a following of dedicated researchers and mad academics established itself around him.
Rakrak created many failed experiments on his journey with the goal of creating the perfect warrior and was sometimes declared insane by contemporary witnesses.
Despite what the doubters said, after many decades of research and failure, he finally created his first creature that could reproduce.
The manticore.

> "To create a manticore you need a living animalus. I have captured one that is unworthy. His mutations are weak, so he won't make a good manticore. But I need material to experiment with - and this one won't hurt.
>
> --- From the notes of Rakrak

Although he had finally succeeded in creating a creature capable of reproducing, his creation could not be considered intelligent by any stretch of the imagination - the creature was so aggressive that it attacked most living things - except its creator - on sight.

Many years passed, and Rakrak was never able to reach his goal.
One day he disappeared without a trace and his fate was never known.
Without his leadership, his research group turned more and more into a fanatical cult.
Many members disagreed about the direction the research should take.
As a result, many different subgroups and currents emerged, some of which also managed to create subspecies of the manticore.

The Animali tribes considered the manticore an insult to their honor.
An affront whose very existence was already an insult.
The Animali went to war against these abominations from the Ice Country, mercilessly killing any Manticore they could find, as well as any of Rakrak's cultists.
This was one of the few times when large numbers of Animali left the Ice Country.
Although Rakrak himself was on their list, he remained missing and neither the Animali nor anyone else has seen him since.

## Places of interest

### The gathering points of the Animali


Some of the most worth seeing places in the Ice Country are among the gathering points of the Animali. These include <font color="green">[The mountaing top of Sro](#Sro)</font> and also the places <font color="green">[The cave of Khazak](#The cave of Khazak)</font> where the Animali are known to gather. Khazak is the only place where all Animali tribes gather every year, and although no human has ever entered the cave, it is said to be a feast for the eyes.
