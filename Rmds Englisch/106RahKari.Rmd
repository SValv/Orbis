## The story of Rah Kari

The Rah Kari originated in the desert west of Atumpet - that desert now known as "Eid' Rah Kari". Originally several non-contiguous tribes who fought themselves at every opportunity, the earlier Rah Kari were called uncivilized barbarians with disdain by their neighbors to the east - present-day Atumpet. They were known even then for excellent breeding of mounts, although at that time they were mostly camels. These were much more suitable for the desert than the horses for which they are known today. From trade transactions between the tribes and Atumpet for those camels also come the first records of the Rah Kari, as the tribes at that time had no historiography or other documentation. It is probably important to mention that they became known as Rah Kari only later, until then they were simple nomads from the upper desert.

### From blood grows loyalty

On a day when the sun was shrouded in darkness, one of the tribes received a child who was given the name Kha'fan. Even at the age of six, Kha'fan turned out to be something special. He defeated the village elders in complicated games of wits and posed riddles that none of his tribe could solve. At the age of 10, Kha'fan invented the slingshot, a weapon that the Rah Kari use to this day. True to the omens of his birth, he grew up and early took on the tribe's most important tasks, which require a quick mind.
When Kha'fan turned 15, a raiding tribe was spotted nearby and Kha'fan had to go into the field for the first time. The slingshots Kha'fan had invented proved to be unbeatable. Coupled with the speed of the camels and dromedaries, he and his tribe quickly killed a large portion of the raiders, who were gradually put to flight and ran - not that this was of any use, since the range of the slings and the speed of the horsemen made it almost impossible to escape. Soon only one of the raiders was left, a boy no older than Kha'fan, wearing neither armor nor helmet and wielding a rusty sword as a weapon. As the riders surrounded and taunted him, hurling stone after stone at him, he threw back the first stone.

The thrown stone pierced the helmet of the Sharif, the chief of Kha'fan's tribe, and exited through the back of his head. The riders looked shocked as the youth charged at them with his sword, killing rider after rider with ease. His strength and speed were unmatched. With his bare hands, he tore off a leg of a dromedary and hurled it at the rider, who died as a result. Blows and hurled stones that would have killed much larger men did not even slow the youth down - and the strength of his legs was sufficient to keep up with the speed of mounted warriors.

As the young raider raged among his tribe's troops, Kha'fan realized that they would not be able to defeat him in battle. Using his acumen as a weapon, he took charge of the warriors and instructed them to ride on a route where they could lure the young raider into a quicksand vortex they knew. The warriors listened to him, for no one else knew anything to do, and Kha'fan was known for his quick mind. In fact, they managed to lure the youth into the quicksand according to plan. The youth did not understand that the more he struggled and fought, the faster he sank, and so the riders had time to surround him and pelt him with stones until he collapsed unconscious. An undertaking that should take several minutes and several hundred stones.

Kha'fan, who thanks to his successful strategy was proclaimed the new Sharif by the soldiers, ordered the unconscious youth to be taken as a prisoner and tied up with the thickest ropes. When the youth woke up from unconsciousness, he was in Kha'fan's tent and he looked at him as he looked at him.

> "Who are you that you are able to defy death and that a whole army is not enough to judge you?"
>
> --- Kha'fan to Tarkus Rah

The marauder and Kha'fan exchanged only a few words until the marauder broke the rope holding him with superhuman strength. One of the words was his name - Tarkus Rah. Startled by the superhuman strength of Tarkus Rah, Kha'fan drew his sword and the two circled each other ready to kill the other. But Tarkus Rah's incredible strength impressed Kha'fan, just as Tarkus Rah was impressed by his cunning. As they looked deeply at each other, the feeling and knowledge of belonging to each other by the will of fate filled them both, and they fell into each other's arms, sharing the bed as well as the meal. They swore eternal fidelity to each other and would do all this until the end of their days. From blood and hatred came true love that would endure for eternity.

### The Wanderer and the Dreamer

The people of the tribe of Kah'fan did not accept the survival of Tarkus Rah, who had caused their tribe so much suffering, nor the fact that the marauder and their Sharif shared bed and life. And so the two young men decided to leave the tribe together and build a new life. But in Tarkus Rah the desire for battle and blood burned just as strongly as in Kha'fan the desire for conversation and mystery.

As the two wandered further and further into the steppe, they met two more figures wandering alone, one of whom was an old man named Asb'Kartes, who was skilled in the art of civilized conversation and with whom Kah'fan quickly befriended. Despite the hot weather that was prevalent in the desert during the day, Asb'Kartes always wore a thick brown robe because, he explained to them, he suffered from a skin disease that turned his skin gray and gave his face an eerie appearance, and he did not want to frighten other people.
The other wanderer of the two talked a lot but hardly anyone ever understood what he wanted to say, so cryptic was the expression. Only Asb'Kartes seemed to be able to follow his words now and then. The fourth was called Amdju, which was an unusual name by any standard, but certainly not a real one.

> "The sand is a poor wretch, would that he were blue and fair like his brother. But time condemns him to an existence as a dead creature, bringing no real warmth to anyone, try as he might. So it is hot in his womb although it is not warm, and warm it is in the cold brother's womb."
>
> --- Amdju over the dunes of the upper desert

The two quickly realized that whatever Amdju touched, touched their senses - whether it was his words or his songs, whether it was a sketch or a prepared painting, his presence was a constant influence full of unknown emotions and stirred feelings. Tarkus Rah, who let feelings just happen, was impressed by this - in contrast to Kha'fan who was uncomfortable not understanding things. But since everyone got along well with one of the other group, two teams of two soon became a team of four.

Most of the time it was Asb'Kartes who led the way, since he knew the area very well. He led them to a village called Nustain, where no one lacked food and there was plenty available for guests. In the desert, such a place was a miracle, and even running water was to be found there, and green trees, as well as a merry people.

![The Oasis Village of Nusrain](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/OasisCity.jpg)

Amdju was immediately delighted and mingled with the celebrating people, who were put in an even better mood by his songs. And while Tarsus Rah took advantage of the festivities to brawl with the strong men of the village, Kha'fan, accompanied by Asb'Kartes, set out to find the source of the village's abundance.

Thus they found Pseptha, who was treated almost like a goddess by the people of the village.

### The Oasis and the Northern Desert

Pseptha was young and beautiful in stature, and everything she touched and tended became green and fertile. Thus it was her care that ensured that the village could live in happiness and abundance.
When she saw Kha'fan, however, she looked at him sadly and they spoke - for they both knew that they belonged to each other.

> I grieve because I know that I am destined to accompany you even though I have created my happiness here. But where I go, may this oasis last forever and bring joy and fruit to the children and children's children of this place, until the world goes out like a glowing fly in the darkness, and it shall be called Nusrain from this day forth."
>
> --- Pseptha to Kha'fan

To the grief of the inhabitants, Pseptha, together with Kha'fan and his friends, left the oasis village of Nusrain, and although they wept bitterly, Pseptha knew she had to go. So they wandered through the desert for 40 days and 40 nights, following Asb'Kartes until he collapsed and was unable to get up. His illnesses and his age did not allow him to go on, and soon the vultures circled over his body, defeated by life. Kha'fan and Pseptha were very upset about this, since he was their map their interlocutor and their friend. So the traveling party kept watch together and tried to strengthen him with food and drink - but despite their best efforts he did not get up again.

It happened that after several days of watching and hoping, a caravan passed by. And although most of them did not want to help and went straight on, there was one young woman, named Sha'fra, who stopped. When she saw the sick man, she could not bring herself to go to him and nurse him, complaining to her brother. After only a few minutes, Asb'Kartes was back on his feet and was more vital and strong than he had been for months. He immediately recognized her incredible potential and asked her to leave everything behind and come with them.
Although she had a great need to accompany the group, she refused the request of the Asb'Kart, as she was obliged to her brother. However, he joined the travelers and spoke with Kha'fan and Pseptha - and when he learned about their incredible talents, he knew he could make much value out of them, so he asked to come along. Although Tarkus Rah doubted his motives and wanted to strike him down, they took him along at the insistence of the Asb'karte. Thus, the merchant Meliodas and the healer Shafra became part of the group.

### The Gray Mountain

Asb'Kartes led the traveling party far to the west, to the end of the upper desert. The journey was dangerous, but the sharp mind of Kha'fan and the mighty fighting power of Tarkus Rah were more than enough to keep the group safe. Along the way, Meliodas installed handles and trading posts in almost every village, showing the villagers how they could improve their lives and earning the gratitude of many tribes.
Kha'fan, Shafra, and Pseptha also managed to build a following with their gifts, while Tarkus Rah tended to earn admiration for his strength from the men and women of the tribes.

Asb'Kartes set the gray mountain as a destination for the group. They did not know why, but although he did not feel the need to explain it to his group either, they followed him.
After several months of hard walking through the dunes of the upper desert, they reached the Gray Wasteland. A place so desolate that not even the talents of the Pseptha could create fertility in this place.
They knew after the first kilometer that they would never get to the Grey Mountain alive this way. So they asked Asb'Kartes if this was really the best option to get to the mountain. After a moment's thought, Asb'Kartes smiled and led them out of the Gray Wasteland to a village the people called Tirach.

In Tirach there was a famous animal whisperer. It was said that he trained the best dromedaries in the entire upper desert, and they called him Hestua. When Meliodas had negotiated a fair price for the dromedaries, Hestua expressed that he felt he had to go with them. Since he knew best how to control the mounts and they were much calmer than usual in his presence, the group took him along. He got along wonderfully with Tarkus Rah, and the two quickly became such good friends that if Kha'fan had not blindly trusted Tarkus Rah, he probably would have become jealous.

![The H'Abunaptra](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Habunaptra.jpg)

With the Hestua's mounts, they soon arrived in the Gray Wasteland and began to make their way through the inhospitable terrain before the H'Abunaptra.  
After several days, they reached the sacred mountain with many hardships.

> "A lonely giant stands in the gray sea and sleeps, no man can climb it. He who does sees clearly, sees as Orbis Aestea could be and should be."
>
> --- Amdju about the H'Abunaptra

Climbing the mountain was not an easy task and so it took them several days. They found edible fruits on the mountain, which they had never seen before, and fed on them. And although they wanted to rest, Asb'Kartes insisted on leading them further and further up.

Then they reached the top. No one knows exactly what happened there, only that from there on their life and purpose changed fundamentally and they began to build the Kingdom of the South.

> "No one could have prepared the community for what they saw. They saw the past and gained their knowledge. They saw what the future could be and how to reach that state. But the most interesting thing about it was that we all saw the same thing, thought the same thing and felt the same thing. We got one."
>
> --- Meliodas

After two weeks, they woke up together again. Each of them realized inwardly that the others were his comrades-in-arms, but also that some pieces of the puzzle were still missing. They had a vision for the world and how it should look like and they were determined to realize it. They realized that their qualities, their powers and their affiliation were stronger than before. It was as if a dam had been broken that existed before without anyone being able to perceive it, and now the river was flowing freely.

From that day on, they called themselves the "Rah Kari" - those who acquired the knowledge.

### The first steps

The journey back through the Gray Wasteland was arduous and they talked little to each other. The animals had died because of their long time on H'Abunaptra, so they had to walk.
They knew that, except for Tarkus Rah, each of them was vulnerable should they be attacked. A risk they did not want to take, because of their newfound mission.
So they sought out the first tribes and convinced them of their path. And although the tribes could neither understand nor see their way, they followed them because of their godlike abilities. So they took some men of the convinced tribes for protection and divided to spread the word.

> "They do not believe in what we believe. They follow us, but they are not Rah Kari, not knowers. Nor can they be, they who have not climbed H'Abunaptra. But that is not important. We don't need them to know, we need them as eyes and ears as a means to an end. Only through the believers can we realize our dream for everyone's good. The individual believer is not important in this. Unless he is a key."
>
> --- Kha'fan at the beginning of the expansion

So it came to pass that after a few months the great tribes of the upper desert were united under the banner of Rah Kari. Either they had bowed, or Tarkus Rah and his growing detachment of soldiers saw to it that their successors joined the Rah Kari. Thus the tribes joined the Rah Kari and the Sharifs gave way to complete rule by the keys of the Rah Kari - a title given to Asb'Kartes, Kha'fan, Tarkus Rah, Pseptha, Hestua, Shafra, Meliodas and Amdju.

![The cavalry of the early Rah Kari in battle](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Dromedary.jpg)

Through the talents of the keys, the Rah Kari empire quickly flourished. Mediolas managed to boost the economic situation of the previously unrelated tribes like never before. Pseptha fed partly previously starving peoples, Kha'fan equipped them with never-before-seen technology that simplified all previous work, and Tarkus Rah destroyed bandits and other evildoers that threatened the tribes. But one of the greatest benefits was the Asb'karte's edict: to transport corpses to H'Abunaptra. That the corpses never awoke was proof to even the most stubborn doubters of the divinity of the keys.

But although the small empire of the Upper Desert prospered, insofar as this is possible in a resource-poor and economically weak desert, the Keys of the Rah Kari were not satisfied. For that for which they sought, they had not yet found.

And so, after 3 years of intensive search in their own realm, they turned their gaze to the fortress city of Atumpet.


### The Siege of Atumpet

Atumpet was an impressive city - at least for a desert city. Of course, it is not comparable to Atumpet today, but even then the city was large, the walls strong, and there was enough water and food to make it viable. At that time Atumpet was inhabited by a tribe called Kartin.
The Kartin were hostile to all outside their people and greeted Rah Kari ambassadors unfriendly and under arms. Soon the Keys had had enough and sent an army under Tarkus Rah and Kha'fan to bring the city under their control.

The first battles proved to be very difficult. The Rah Kari army was smaller, less trained, and less well equipped. And while the dromedary riders were unsurpassed in the desert, they were far inferior to the war elephants and horses of Atumpet's army.
To make matters worse, Atumpet possessed artillery and archers, advantages the Rah Kari did not have.

![Tarkus Rah faces a war elephant alone](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/TRWarElephant.jpg)

Although the battles were good for the Rah Kari wherever Tarkus Rah himself fought, they lost ground very quickly on the other fronts. After a week, they had lost a large part of the troops. So Kha'fan and Tarkus Rah retreated and waited for reinforcements for a second campaign.

This second campaign would take place two years later. This time all of the keys were involved - and with them a much larger army than the first attempt, as they had armed and drafted everyone capable of holding a weapon.
Due to the outnumbering of the enemy, Atumpet's army tried to play off their better training and equipment by providing for many small partial battles. In one of these attempts, Atumpet's elite cavalry, led by the Sharif's son, ran into the Rah Kari vanguard, led by Tarkus Rah.
This misfortune robbed Atumpet of its best troops as well as its heir to the throne in a single day and destroyed the morale of the defenders. After this incident, Atumpet's troops hid behind their walls.

![The Heir to the Throne of Atumpet on his horse](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Heir to the ThroneAtumpet.jpg)

For three years the Rah Kari besieged Atumpet without being able to breach the walls. The Keys used this time to exploit their talents to the fullest: Meliodas established firm trade links and had roads built to all the major settlements in the upper desert. Hestua began to incorporate the available horses and elephants into its breeding program, resulting in the now famous horses of the Rah Kari. Ultimately, it was a collaboration of Pseptha and Kha'fan that sealed Atumpet's fate. Together they diverted the Setra so that the raging floods swept down the walls and half the city. This created the branch of the Setra River known today as Psepthara. The troops of Tarkus Rah had an easy time after destroying the defenses and annihilated the rest of the army. And so the Rah Kari took control of what was left of Atumpet.

It would take 15 years to repair the damage caused by the rerouting of the river. However, the new branch of the Setra River - the Pseptha - created an opportunity for agriculture. This was fully exploited by Psephta and soon the area around Atumpet was more fertile than any other region in the world today. Thus, Atumpet remains the lifeline of the Rah Kari to this day.

Over the centuries, Atumpet was to become the jewel of the south. No other city in the world is said to be as great, impressive and beautiful as the work of art that Atumpet represents. And never has a traveler entered it without being amazed, unless he has been there many times.

### The search for the key

Despite the success of the Kah Kari over Atumpet and the prosperity of the young nation, the Keys were not satisfied. They still lacked what they were looking for. Even Atumpet's conquest had not given them the information they wanted.

Meanwhile, the Rah Kari's worship of the Keys became increasingly fanatical. They were seen not as humans, but as living gods. But instead of the people worshipping and desiring the vision as the keys did, they worshipped the keys themselves.
Some of the Rah Kari tried to emulate the keys and climb H'Abunaptra, but no one ever made it to the mountain alive; it seemed that H'Abunaptra only tolerated the keys, even though they had only climbed it once.

So it came to pass that Asb'Kartes set out with some of the best warriors of the Rah Kari to go in search of what the keys sought.

After many years of travel and searching, Asb'Kartes arrived near the dwarven city of "", which to this day is the largest and most influential of the dwarven cities, due to its special forge. The foothills of the dwarven city were fertile and strategically valuable for the new nation of Rah Kari, but that did not interest Asb'Kartes. He was only there to do his job.

> "Without the last of the keys, we will never be able to revive the dream. I have already gathered 7 out of 8 of the keys, but where is the last component? I can't have lost it, I've been too well prepared for that."
>
> --- Asb'Kartes

Another three years went by when Asb'Kartes was ambushed by a small tribe. Suddenly, he and his soldiers were attacked from behind and completely unexpectedly. But the bodyguard of Asb'Kartes had been chosen by Tarkus Rah himself. The well-equipped soldiers of Asb'Kart quickly managed to eliminate the attacking tribe. However, Asb'Kartes was surprised to learn that the attack was planned and executed by a 14-year-old boy - and Asb'Kartes immediately suspected that this boy must be the last of the keys. So he took the boy, who was called Unas Utet, with him. Unas Utet, feeling the same call as all the others of the voices before him, came along willingly, knowing that he should follow Asb'Kartes.

![The attackers sneak up on the Asb'Kartes' entourage](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/rahKari3.jpg)

It quickly became apparent that Unas Utet had a flair for extracting and evaluating information and could build and use information networks very quickly.

Asb'Kartes took the boy to H'Abunaptra because, in order to become a full-fledged key, he too would have to see the vision that the others had seen and follow it with the same fervor.
After a long journey, they finally arrived at H'Abunaptra and Asb'Kartes led Unas Utet up the mountain and the mountain showed him the same thing it had shown the other keys.

While Unas Utet received the visions of the mountain, Asb'Kartes explored the nature of the mountain in more detail - there he was to find something that would corrupt his soul and turn him against the vision of the other keys and make him betray everything he had built up so far.

### The death of a dream

After Unas Utet's enlightenment, he and Kha'fan set off in the direction of the other keys in Atumpet. There they met and Unas Utet got to know his comrades-in-arms.
They knew that they had to secure important artifacts and then climb H'Abunaptra together.

No one knew where the artifacts were located, but this is where Unas Utet's special talents came into play. He quickly built an informant network and within two years they had the necessary artifacts together.
But even as he searched for the artifacts, it occurred to Unas Utet that someone privy to the sacred plan was working against them. However, since he never assumed that any of the keys could betray them, he thought it rather unlikely. Nevertheless, the evidence for this grew with each passing day, as Asb'Kartes attempted to destroy the artifacts through agents loyal to him - but failed against the Unas Utet's network.

Once the artifacts were in the city and the keys met to confer and prepare for departure, Asb'Kartes realized he needed a more direct way to stop his fellow warriors. And so he used assassins to stop the keys.

Asb'Kartes called Kha'fan to him to discuss the best route to H'Abunaptra, and on Asb'Kartes' way back, the assassins ambushed Kha'fan. Surprised and without too much combat experience, they overpowered him - and so Kha'fan, one of the greatest of all men, fell under the knife of a treacherous serpent.
His death was quickly noticed when he did not come home to Tarkus Rah. They found his body the following day and Tarkus Rah went crazy with pain and anger. The keys decided to act quickly, immediately they gathered and left for H'Abunaptra with the body of the Kha'fan.

> "Time is of the essence now, perhaps there is enough life left in him to complete his task. We need all the keys and all the artifacts to make the dream come true and awaken the mountain. Quickly get the artifacts! Hestua get the fastest animals you have! We must leave immediately or there goes all the work for our dream of a better world!"
>
> --- Mediolas to the keys

Asb'Kartes tried to slow the group down the entire journey, wanting to prevent the group from arriving at the mountain in time. This caught the attention of Unas Utet, who suspected Asb'Kartes anyway, and so he confronted Asb'Kartes. When the treachery of Asb'Kartes came up, he was killed by Tarkus Rah in a fit of rage, without anyone present being able to do anything about it. For the hatred due to the loss of his beloved made Tarkus Rah more than furious. And so they left the cadaver of the Asb'Kart, gray from the skin disease, in the desert and hurried to reach H'Abunaptra.

Two days later, the group climbed the mountain with the body of Kha'fan.
Since then nothing has been heard of them, they never descended again, and all the people who tried to follow them were never seen again.

### The Kingdom of the South

After the keys disappeared, they left behind a disorganized but thriving empire. An empire that worshipped them as gods.
The higher administrators of the young, abandoned nation then created the structure by which the Rah Kari are organized to this day.

> "The gods have ascended the mountain, now it is up to us to continue in their will."
>
> --- Preios Dha'Fan

Eight cults were created, one for each of the Keys - except for the traitor Asb'Kartes - dedicated to the different specialties of the Keys. Thus, the path of Kha'fan was that of the craftsmen, the path of Tarkus Rah that of the soldiers, the path of Pseptha that of the farmers and agriculturists, that of Mediolas for the merchants, that of Amdju for the artists, the path of Shafra for the healers and the women, that of Hestua for the breeders of the mounts, and that of Unes Utet for the guardians. Each of these paths was to be led by a high priest, who together would guide the country.

![A high priest of the Rah Kari with a ritual blade](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/RahKariPriester.jpg)

They decided that dead people - like Kha'fan of the Keys and like under Asb'Kartes - should continue to be brought to H'Abunaptra to prevent their revival at that time also originated the ritual of <font color="green">[Sacred Bones]()</font>.
The Rah Kari began to believe that the Keys now resided on H'Abunaptra as gods, and there judged them and guided and protected the dead in the afterlife.


### The War of the Lower Desert {#WarOfTheLowerDesert}

After the Rah Kari regrouped following the disappearance of the Keys, they saw the need to secure Atumpet's strategic position. Due to the fact that the steppes were very vast and easily accessible, it was necessary to create a zone between possible threats and the capital of Atumpet, which would ensure the necessary room for maneuver.

Thus, the Rah Kari went to war in the eternal steppes of Appothi, where the former nomadic tribes had united under a Sharif named Amair.
Both factions were about equal in strength, and the resulting conflict was to decide which empire would dominate the south in the long run.

Amair's army consisted almost entirely of cavalry, while the Rah Kari had an equally large but more infantry-heavy army.

![The Ranks of the Rah Kari](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/RahKariInfantry1.jpg)

In the months that followed, the Rah Kari used information from the Guardians to target their opponents' supply lines and water supplies, reducing the range of movement of Anair's more mobile army. Otherwise, the Rah Kari shunned open combat unless they had the advantage. They would continue to refine and eventually perfect this strategy over the years.
After several months of playing cat and mouse, a major confrontation finally occurred. The Amair army had been suffering from a shortage of supplies for weeks due to the actions of the Rah Kari. Furthermore, they had the worse geographic position.  The Rah Kari took advantage of this and fell upon the weaker army. Amair surrendered 6 hours after the battle began.

Since transporting corpses across the desert was not too easy, the battlefield is still a place teeming with Awakened to this day and is now seen as the origin [of the lost army](#lostarmy). Due to the sufficient distance to all important cities and roads of the Rah Kari, this accumulation of living corpses is largely ignored.

![The Walls of Keshep](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Keshep.jpg)

After their victory, the Rah Kari captured the city of Keshep and enslaved the inhabitants. Gradually, they consolidated their power in the region and eventually took it over completely.
Keshep is still the second largest city of the Rah Kari and is of great importance, especially militarily, as its proximity to the Misty Grove and the Empire or Eldria is just as important as the fact that Keshep virtually "shields" Atumpet.

### The expeditions

The following years of the Rah Kari are marked by expeditions to various parts of the country. The most important of these were those leading to the Iron Red Desert and those that made contact with the Dwarven City.

#### The expeditions to the iron-red desert {-}

#### The Expedition to the Sky Peak Mountains {-}

Nearly 120 years after the conquest of Atumpet, the Rah Kari crossed the Setra and established a bridgehead across the river. Since the Setra was too large and too riparian to build bridges, all contact with this bridgehead was made by ship. The new area turned out to be a great asset for the Rah Kari. In addition to the relatively fertile soil on the north side of the Setra, the proximity to the volcanic state of the dwarves proved especially useful. Although initial contact was bumpy, trade between the peoples quickly became essential to the Rah Kari's military and civilization projects. The fruits of this trade consisted primarily of constructs with all manner of uses and high-quality weapons with which to equip elite Rah Kari soldiers.

The area gained even more relevance due to the rockslide that created the Bonefield Gorge, as it created a direct access to the Empire, which was located in this area.

#### Other Expeditions {-}

A few expeditions were also launched to the Misty Grove, and thus to Eldria. However, the raw materials that could be extracted through them were not worth the risk that the journey through the Misty Grove represented. In the first expedition, over 800 soldiers, traders and explorers set out from Keshep towards the Misty Grove. Of these 800 people, only 120 arrived in Eldria - and most of the provisions and goods they had with them remained lost in the Misty Grove.
Although the Rah Kari often continued to try to establish regular trade relations with Eldria, the Misty Grove made this largely impossible. Only the bravest private traders attempt to use the Misty Grove as a transportation route.

### The Slave Revolt {#Slave RevoltRahKari}

As most previous readers know, there are eight deities among the Rah Kari, these are the keys, with the exception of the Asb'Kart. However, in their hatred of the Rah Kari regime and their standing in society, more and more of the socially low citizens, especially the slaves, stylized Asb'Kartes up as the heroic enemy of the Rah Kari order. In this way, a traitor became a symbol of freedom, dominion over oneself, and a system free from religious regularities and the constraints of the path. This interpretation of Asb'Kart gained increasing popularity and was widely worshipped as a god.
The guardians saw the danger first, sounded the alarm early, and began to find and eradicate the cults of Asb'Kart. However, they quickly became too numerous for the guardian cult to stop them in its current form.

![In the Rah Kari, slaves of the individual paths often fight each other - for the glory of the cult](Pictures/Flavor/Platzhalter/BrotSpiele.jpg)

Driven by thoughts of freedom and the insane idea of being able to find their own place in society, the cult's first believers launched escape attempts. In response, Rah Kari slaves began tattooing the emblem of the cult to which they belonged on their foreheads. This so-called penitent sign would burn through a slave's head upon contact with sunlight if he decided to escape his duty to his cult.

As this technique spread, slaves began to revolt, sometimes violently. The greatest revolt began in Nusrain, the same village where Kha'fan and Asb'Kartes had picked up Pseptha at that time, in a skeala - a school for exhibition fighting for the entertainment of the cult's superiors.
There, an eldritch warrior who had been captured and enslaved as a merchant's caravan guard for theft was trained. Although his name is no longer known, he was the one who started the slave revolt. Through his work, the entire Skeala fell to the belief in Asb'Kartes and dreamed of self-determination.
At that time, fighters still had relatively free access to weapons, so it was easy for them to secretly take out the guards and attempt an escape.

Soon the group under the Eldrier, who became a hero of the slaves, had freed all of Nusrain's slaves. More and more successful as well as unsuccessful slave revolts swept through the Rah Kari empire.
Thus it happened that the escaped slaves were able to raise an army that numbered over 50000 armed men. They defeated three smaller armies of the Rah Kari in the field, but neither they, nor the armies of the Rah Kari with which they were hunted, had larger contingents of mounted warriors.

This was to change when the new son of Tarkus, the high priest of the Cult of Tarkus Rah, raised his own army specifically for slave hunting. This army was an enormously mobile task force, composed mainly of cavalry and particularly fast fighting constructs. Remnants of defeated armies were assembled as infantry support. They re-supplied the slave army and acted as decoys for the mobile forces to flank or rear.
The slave army lost all coordination after only a few targeted attacks. Panic broke out and the previously victorious slaves abandoned any formation. They tried to flee in all possible directions. But the more mobile forces of the Rah Kari pursued them and killed every one. Of the slaves, only about 8000 survived this battle. Another 2000 succumbed to injuries and further persecution by the Rah Kari. However, some managed to escape to the Grey Wasteland, where there are still descendants of escaped slaves or fresh escaped slaves.

The greatest aftermath of the slave revolt, however, was of greater significance, which the guardians now encountered. The Cult of the Keepers was now not only external intelligence, but equally responsible for internal security and the pursuit of possible cults of Asb'Kart. One of the first consequences of the uprising was the banning of the Asb'Kart's name, which is why he is officially known as the Deceiver. Also, the tattoo duty for slaves, which binds them to their cult, was introduced.

Because of the focus, the Keepers became state-bearing for the Rah Kari and are their best weapon in the fight against the enemies of the Rah Kari. They are the biggest and best intelligence service in Orbis Astea and have an impact far beyond the borders of their country.

### The Great War

After nearly 200 years of peace, albeit a peace that was oppressively maintained by the Keepers and their persecution of dissenters, the conflict that became known as the "Great War" occurred.
After the conquest of Eldria by the Empire, the Rah Kari supreme were very worried about how aggressive and expansive the Empire was behaving. Thus, they decided to launch a preemptive strike against important military imperial infrastructure, thus reducing the Empire's potential to wage wars for a long time.

The Rah Kari began the war simultaneously on two fronts, attacking the Empire both in Eldria and through the Bonefield Gorge. In Nors, however, the attack was repulsed hard by the Empire. The exact course of the war is described in more detail in the [History of the Empire and can be found here](#KaisGroWar). However, an imperial counterattack was repelled by the strong fortifications of Bonefield Gorge on the Rah Kari side.

![The Rah Kari Cavalry](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/RahKavallerie.jpg)

From the beginning, the front in Eldria had the problem of the fog grove that had to be crossed. Although the Rah Kari managed to draw some Eldrian principalities to their side through the efforts of the Guardians, they still had too few troops and material to actually oppose the Empire when it came to counterattack. And since the Eldrian allies were only reliable to a limited extent, they also broke off their actions rather quickly. This was especially due to the fact that the principalities were very divided in this conflict.

Although the Rah Kari lost fewer troops than the Empire in the Great War and suffered fewer defeats, it cannot be counted as a Rah Kari victory. The Rah Kari failed to fulfill their goal of weakening the Empire. The Empire remains capable of action and is very aware of the threat posed by the Rah Kari.

The war has also allowed the Guardians to establish a large presence in the Empire and in Eldria, and thus to become well established there.



## The Society of Rah Kari

The social structure of the Rah Kari corresponds to a caste system, which dictates the life of the members through certain paths of religion. Each Rah Kari is assigned at birth to a god and thus to a path, which stands for a certain field of activity in society. The possible paths are:

* Warrior = Tarkus Rah
* Farmer = Pseptha
* Craft = Kha'fan
* Horse breeder = Hestua
* Healer = Shafra
* Artist = Amdju
* Merchant = Meliodas
* Guardian = Unes Utet
* Rebellion = the 9.

The guardian caste is responsible for the transport of the corpses and takes care of the control of the other castes.
Women form the caste of the tribal mother and take care of all medical matters. Therefore they are also called the "healers". For this reason, they can easily be married into any caste. Thereby, however, they take over none to few tasks of the caste of their husband, but continue to devote themselves to their healer activity.
Among the Rah Kari, strict monogamy prevails. If a healer sleeps with a man other than her own, she is considered defiled, as is he, and thus falls out of favor with the path. This causes the first offenses to diminish her chances of social advancement during her lifetime and in the afterlife. If a caste member falls into disfavor, this is not transmitted to the family. If there is an accumulation of offenses, this person is degraded to the slave of his path.


The god of freedom, or "the 9th" represents the god of slaves. This "hero" is the first rebel who was executed and mistakenly buried in the sacred lake. For this reason, he is worshipped by escaped slaves and followers of the caste who are dissatisfied with their duties. However, if it becomes known to the guardian caste that a Rah Kari worships the god of freedom, he is hunted down, as the guardians try to eradicate the cult of the 9th.

The goal of the paths is for everyone to live according to the teachings of their path in order to achieve a higher rank in the afterlife. Slaves follow their path in hopes of a better afterlife, as they belong to the social lowest class, which is called Heri. The social highest level is called Sulthanai, this also establishes the highest level in the afterlife to which the dead can ascend.

If a slave escapes, he is forced to wear a mask in the desert to avoid burning, since gods of the cult see everything that touches the sun. Burned are signs of the guardian cult Escaped often join the pirates.

## Economic situation of the Rah Kari

The Keeper Cult has an important, almost statist, trade relationship with the dwarves. The dwarves provide the Keeper Cult with crossbows, technology, and dwarven constructs. In return, they receive food, draft animals, and materials.

## Military of the Rah Kari

The army of the Rah Kari can be divided into two parts: The regular soldiers and the auxiliary soldiers. Regular soldiers follow the path of the Tarkus Rah and are often the important units of the army.

> "Often young soldiers make the mistake of thinking that the Rah Kari soldiers are completely inferior to us. This may be true for those auxiliary soldiers who are conscripted just before the war begins. A proper Rah Kari soldier, those trained from childhood, is more than a match for an imperial soldier, sometimes even superior. Fortunately, these make up only one in ten in the armies of the Southern Shits."
>
> --- Cartions Legens, Centurion in the Eighth Legion during the Great War

The Rah Kari army is organized into armies under a commander-in-chief, usually a high-ranking Tarkus Rah, and a high priest. Armies vary in size and can range from 5000 to 60000 soldiers.

### The Weaponry of the Rah Kari

#### Infantry {- #RahInfantry}

*The infantry of the Rah Kari is significantly lighter than that of the Empire, however* XXXX

##### Desert Shields {-}

Desert Shields are the sword or axe infantry of the Rah Kari and are often seen. Since they usually fight without formation they are very flexible.

![Despite the name Desert Shields, not all of them carry a shield](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/RahKariSoldier1.jpg)

##### DesertSpears {-}

The spearmen of the Rah Kari are the backbone of their infantry, often fighting in line formations. They are good for holding lines and advancing slowly. However, they are a target for Imperial artillery.

Despite their low mobility and their weaknesses on uneven terrain, these troops are quite effective in narrow places and on the flat field, for the low training time.

##### Heavy Spearmen {-}

The heavy spearmen are very similar to the desert spears. However, there are differences, such as the much heavier armor, longer spears, and smaller shields.

![A heavy spearman with a two-handed spear - the so-called Sarissa](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/RahKariSoldier2.jpg)

#### Ranged Fighter {- #RahRangeFighter}

The Rah Kari are generally not known for having great ranged fighters. At most, their ranged fighters fulfill a support role and do not reap glory or good equipment.

##### Desert Slinger {-}

Desert Slingers are the Rah Kari's cheapest ranged units. There is little prestige in being an auxiliary soldier. Additionally, they are almost exclusively auxiliary soldiers who serve as slingers. Slingers usually have no armor and enjoy very short training.

##### Skirmishers {-}

Skirmishers are fast, unarmored infantrymen with throwing spears. They are most effective against cavalry, but can be dangerous to infantry as well. Since they are unarmored, however, they are easily taken out by archers, so a wise commander will give them archers to support them against other archers.

![A skirmisher unit of the Rah Kari](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/planklerschutzen.jpg)

Skirmishers are quick on their feet, throw their dangerous throwing spears, and once they run out of spears, fight with their slings, though they are significantly less dangerous with them.

##### Shortbows {-}


#### Cavalry {- #RahCavalry}

The Rah Kari cavalry is arguably the best in the known world. Their specially bred horses are faster, stronger and more panic resistant than those of any other country. The fact that all Rah Kari heroes are or were cavalrymen makes the easily recognizable picture even more complete. As nomads, the Rah Kari have a long tradition with mounts of every kind, which is why some even manage to ride scrogan scorpions and elephants into battle.

##### light desert riders {-}

##### Skrogan riders {-}

A few Rah Kari dare to mount captured <font color="green">[Skrogan Scorpions](#Skrogan)</font> and some of them even survive this madness. These survivors become skrogan riders. Unlike skrogan scorpions used alone, skrogan riders are XXXX

##### War Elephants {-}

War Elephants are the heaviest armored units any military in Orbis Astea can muster. These running battle tanks are a death sentence for infantry, cavalry, and any other units unlucky enough to come within the elephant's range.

The Rah Kari begin training elephants as early as 2 years after they are born. The tamers accustom the elephant to tolerate all sounds, smells and conditions of the battlefield. An elephant has the bad habit to run amok and not to distinguish between friend and foe as soon as it is flooded with stimuli. Trained elephants are able to withstand the rampage for longer.

![War elephants break through a phalanx in front of Keshep](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/War elephant.jpg)

#### Constructs of the Rah kari {-}

### Special Units

#### Fre'dan Rah {-}

The Fre'dan Rah are the elite force in the Rah Kari military. Their banner is adorned with the green dragon Grombast, said to have been slain by Tarkus Rah in a duel. Wherever troops enter the battlefield under this banner, the morale of the Rah Kari soldiers increases almost beyond measure.

Both in terms of equipment and training, the Fre'dan pose a great threat to any land force that is not vastly superior in numbers.

![Fre'dan on the way to the front](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/RahKariarmeeschau.jpg)

The Fre'dan recruit from all children who follow the path of Tarkus Rah and are exceptionally strong physically. From this point on, they receive the best training imaginable and are equipped with everything the Southern Empire can muster.

The Fre'dan are about 4000 strong and consist of heavy spearmen, riflemen, skirmishers and XXXX


#### Temple Guards {-}

The Temple Guards are more of a ritual unit than a combat unit. While the Fre'dan move from front to front, the Temple Guardians guard sacred sites, High Priests, and the H'Abunaptra. Becoming a temple guard is arguably the most prestigious position in the Rah Kari army. This is sometimes reflected in the magnificent armor and weapons with which they are equipped.

![A temple guard during training](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/TempleGuard.jpg)

Although the Temple Guards are not as battle-hardened and effective as the Fre'dan, they are still an elite unit with good training that should not be underestimated. However, officers are promoted more by loyalty than skill, which has often led to problems. Temple guards, who are allowed to guard high priests, have their tongues cut off so that they are unable to betray their high priests or pass on information to their enemies.

## The Religion of Rah Kari

The faith of the faction originated from great heroes of the paths that each member of the faction treads. These have been worshipped by increasing numbers of people, giving them god-like status among the mountain, and are therefore represented by high priests and other representatives in the realm. Even small families, in the name of faith, erect small house shrines in memory of their deceased.

### Cult of the Dead

Unlike the Empire, the Rah Kari do not seek to bury their dead and thus keep them from the afterlife, but to give them eternal life under the H'Abunaptra.
The burial takes place over the lake at the foot of the "Lonely Mountain". This is considered the central sacred place of the Rah Kari. While rich people send their relatives in boats with grave goods on their way to the realm of the dead, poor deceased are merely thrown into the water. Here, the lake flows into a hole in the mountain, which leads directly to the realm of the dead, where the revival can take place. Should the awakening take place in the caves under the H'Abunaptra, the Rah Kari believe, the dead person awakens not as a bloodthirsty corpse, but with full consciousness in the service of the gods and the path.

To prevent the dead from rising for certain periods of time, amulets are used that delay the revival for a certain period of time. Since the dead must be brought up to the mountain within this period, it is problematic if, due to very heavy storms or other problems, the transports get stuck for too long and the undead already awaken on the way. When a person awakens outside the mountain, his soul is lost and only a will-less, aggressive earthly shell remains. For the Rah Kari, an unsuccessful resurrection into the afterlife represents one of the worst possible fates.

As already written, the Rah Kari use amulets made of "magic bones" to prolong the time until resurrection. These are placed around the necks of the dead. These bones are typically elven bones or those of other Otherlings. Since there are few of these in the realm of the south, they are usually imported and sold by slavers or pirates. Dwarven bones are officially forbidden for amulet making due to the important relationship between Rah Kari and dwarves, though unofficially they are highly sought after. Only the most powerful and richest families manage to obtain dwarf bones under the table. The upper class usually tries to get dwarf bones, while the ordinary mortals make do with elves and other otherlings. Only the poorest and the slaves have to make do with goblin bones, bones that are socially ostracized and looked down upon.

Escaped slaves also try to reach the H'Abunaptra with their dead to give them a dignified afterlife. However, since the Rah Kari do not want to grant servants to the traitor of the ninth god, slaves are forcibly prevented from doing so. The H'Abunaptra is therefore under constant guard of the best constructs and an elite detachment of temple guards


### The Northern End of the Empire of Rah' Kari - Eid' Tanis


The empire of the Rah Kari was able to expand rapidly thanks to a relatively united leadership. As a result, even the Setra, the river that closed off the land from the celestial peaks, could finally be permanently settled and fortified. Since the lands of Eid'Tanis are extremely fertile and of a more temperate climate than the deserts and steppes of the rest of the region, while at the same time providing access to the Sky Peak Mountains and through the Bonefield Gorge to the Empire, the Rah Kari stationed military garrisons there. Primarily, however, craftsmen and farmers continue to settle there. Molochs, like the capital Atumpet, are not to be found here.
The settlement by the Rah Kari ended a bloody conflict between goblins and orcs. These fought, as usual for simple cultures, in tribal feuds against each other. As a result, these tribes had little to oppose a united Rah Kari army.
The orc tribes made friends with the new ruler more quickly, as they were valuable assets to the Rah Kari as front-line soldiers and alchemists with knowledge of the Heaven's Peak Mountains.
The Goblins, whether their nature or culture, were seen as less cooperative and were almost completely exterminated. The Goblins have since referred to the Rah Kari as Sunburners. This term probably originated over the burnings of the goblins to obtain bones for religious purposes.

Accordingly, the little enslaved and surviving goblins were not eager to live under the rule of this caste-driven culture. Several unsuccessful revolts occurred. Only when the conflicts with the empire increased, the first successes of the goblin revolts appeared. Several representatives managed to flee to the mountains.

This led to permanent hostilities. As a rule, goblins try to kill officers, priests or even simple peasants in order to wear down the Rah Kari. A strategy with limited success so far. The Rah Kari, for their part, respond with orc tribes, which have been feuding with goblins for centuries anyway. In return, they equipped them with armaments.

The empire itself began to support the goblins when the explorer Julius von Triefgraben brought this to the attention of the empire. The goal is supposedly to capture constructs and dwarven steel armor and increase the instability factor.

From then on, relatively loyally, since the best bidder was also the only bidder, the orcs served the Rah Kari as mountain guides, goblin chamber hunters, and front-line soldiers in the border garrisons with the Empire.



### The choice of a high priest:

The high priest of a caste must meet certain requirements to prove himself worthy of service to the Rah Kari. In this regard, the position of high priest must be vacant or foreseeably vacant. This means that the High Priest is terminally ill or has recently passed away.
Those who are eligible for the honor of high priest must have already proven themselves worthy within their caste. If this is in the cult of Meliodas, the merchant caste, most venerable relations or a large network and great wealth of goods and business partners, this is in the warrior caste of Tarkus Rah the head of an abomination or a general of the hostile, which call themselves the Empire.

If the aspirant has fulfilled these tasks and the Sulthanai recognize this act as honorable enough, the aspirant, who must always be the second highest level of his caste himself, a Sulthanai, can be elected in a closed ceremony of the high priests.  However, the non-caste high priests or Sulthanais have no influence on this. The festivities take place afterwards and are celebrated by the path-keepers of the society.
These celebrations can last several days, as the election of a high priest for some occurs only once in their lifetimes.



### The determination of the path of the children:

Children have the task of following the path of their father - that is, to continue his work. In this, it is the task of each young Rahkari to practice learning the skills of his father's caste.  Five days a week the child learns the path of his father. On two days of the week he is taught by the healer caste, often his own mother or in a larger group of a few mothers. Here all children learn the scriptures, healing and caring, and the importance of the life aspects of the Rah Kari. The customs and rites here follow a uniform rhythm. Thus, 2 days the paths of the father are taught. One day the path of the mother, 3 days the path of the father followed by one day the path of the mother. This 2-1-3-1 rule is reflected in almost all the festivals and celebrations of our community.
After 14 summers, the final examination takes place. The young Rah Kari's abilities are tested to determine where his strengths lie. If he is good at writing and quick in spirit, he is given positions that have to do with thinking - bureaucrat positions. If he wields the hand skillfully and vigorously, life as a valuable member follows as a creator of his caste - craftsman, farmer, warrior, etc.
With the completion of the test follows a 4-month period where the now new adult is allowed to travel as he pleases in the realm of Rah Kari.
This serves the young person to learn about the Rah Kari world, perhaps sharpening skills elsewhere in the same caste. Afterwards it is the duty of the eldest to return to the house of the father. The younger born are free to provide their services in the caste throughout the realm of the Rah Kari.
