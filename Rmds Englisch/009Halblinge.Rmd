# Halflings

As, next to the Goblins, the smallest humanoid race, Halflings predominantly inhabit the Night Mountain Valley, which is encircled by the Night Mountains. Thus, halflings and their clans form not only the eastern civilized frontier of the known world, but also probably the least warlike race.

The humanoids, denunciatively called "children" by imperial soldiers, can best be described as dwarfed humans. Their head is large in proportion with representatives of humans. However, according to scholars, this does not result in any intellectual advantage over humans. A natural characteristic of halflings are slightly larger eyes, guaranteed full and colorful hair until old age, as well as a somewhat exaggerated thirst for alcohol and pipe goods.

 

Halflings, to the chagrin of the Empire's bureaucrats, look inconspicuous, move about lightly, and because of their resemblance to children, can pass many an Imperial inspection even with questionable goods. This corresponds to a kind of reverse discrimination against the elves. Although scholarly opinions differ on the discrimination of elves, to what extent they are diabolical or deceitful, the current prevailing opinion on halflings is that they commit fewer crimes and are more upright citizens of the Empire.

 

Their daily life, before the incorporation of the Empire as the Protectorate of Yondalla around 190 A.D., consisted mainly of field work, skirmishes with goblins and orcs, occasional fending off of raids from Eldria and the Borderlands, and partying, drinking, and the princely feasts.

As of yet, it is not known if halflings can ever suffer from obesity, arthritis, or gout. Because of the rich and easy harvests in the Yondalla area, halflings tend to find their own pastimes. This is an interesting sight, especially since the incorporation into the Empire and the cities, as it means that you can meet random experts on historical bridges, elven dialects or the perfect quality of almonds for marzipan on the street. Marzipan is made from nuts from the realms of Rah Kari. In this process, sugar, from Yondalla's sugar beets, and rahkari nuts are ground and mixed.

 

## Company

When one comes to the smaller towns and villages of Yondalla, one notices, in contrast to the Empire or Eldria, how little is given here to the opinions of higher borns, representatives of the Ekklesia, or the orders from Yonda, the capital of Yondalla. One can notice that the halflings mostly discuss and decide their decisions in village assemblies, where all over two dozen winters have a vote.

The procedure here is usually similar. Every new moon, more often if necessary, all those entitled to vote meet in the village hall, another special feature of the halflings. There, a large number of food is then discussed about possible topics. Be it the exchange of reasons, the sale of cattle, the mostly negative attitude towards new decrees from Yonda and the price of the sold food. The latter is incredibly important, as it provides financial security against fluctuations in yields and prices from the fields and yondas. Once all the points have been discussed and written down, this is usually sealed with more gluttony and lots of alcohol. The next day is considered a holiday by the people of Yondala, and it is difficult to get anyone to repair a shoe for a stranger without paying absurd surcharges.

As a result, the smaller villages are very well organized and have a very strong cohesion. This also helps at least against smaller raids of orcs in the north and the goblins at the edges to the night mountains.

 

Before the incorporation into the arms of the empire, the halflings tried to master the problems with the halfling-eating orc tribes and goblins via halfling mercenary groups. Thereby the halflings organized themselves in the villages, sent envoys to the smaller cities from there to the bigger cities and so on. This then resulted in a coherent plan to chase orcs and goblins back out of the territories. In doing so, the halflings tried to attack their physical weakness against orcs or their night blindness against goblins with sheer superiority. This led to the fact that a mercenary troop like "the rolling company" consisted of about 3000 men, who knew how to proceed well trained then very coordinated. Thereby tribe after tribe of orcs and goblins were driven out of the areas. Halflings call this procedure "fool hunt". These measures prevent orc tribes or goblin tribes from penetrating too far into the heart of Yondalla or becoming a more relevant threat. As a result, the entire territory of Yondalla is scoured every 30 winters or so, and all major tribes are wiped out in the process.

 

Besides the "rolling company" -- the name does not come from the man-heavy cheese wheels that are rolled along as provisions -- there are two other companies of Halfling mercenaries that roam the countryside. The rolling company has its base in Alla, usually manned only by stewards and a handful of guards. It covers the east of Yondalla. Its territory goes from the Grohde River to the Vohra. North of the Reik is the company "the Orc Skinners" and south of the Reik is the "Shaman Cooks Company".

 

This kind of cleansing allows the halflings, especially in the years after a chump hunt, an absolute blissful life. These years are also usually very rich in children and usually determine the maximum extent of a village and its cultivated area.

 

When the Empire, 60 years after the "discovery" of Yondalla around 190 A.D. Riga "occupied" Yondalla, the only thing that changed initially for the halflings was exactly the fact that occasionally a few dozen bored imperial soldiers sat around in the villages and got fat. Representatives of the Ekklesia, who traveled around in tow of the imperial army and wanted to proselytize the "wild children", delivered after a short time an equally pathetic picture. The Yondalese simply had no use for the teachings of the Allgod. Some joined it. Many would only go to the holy meetings if they were forced to or if the keeper of the resting place, the priest, literally begged for it or started to pray with the overweight imperial soldiers by chance at new moons while the halflings continued to discuss their concerns.

What was special about this unopposed annexation was the timing of the discovery and annexation. Yondalla was, of course, known to humans far earlier, and trade was likewise conducted, primarily food for weapons. in 130 n. Riga, trade relations were officially established with representatives of Yondalla and then Alla.  The Empire first realized how extensive Yondalla's lands were when the brothers Travian and Zulian Lodian, in a remarkable exploration, surveyed, described and mapped Yondalla all by themselves. This made the Empire aware of what could be gained in Yondalla. About 50 winters of observations on the part of the Empire passed before an army and a plan were drawn up.

The invasion began in 188 n. Riga and led along the Reik directly towards Yonda and then Alla. Since the halflings had few bad experiences with humans and were often even pleased to see heavily armed humans, as long as they did not have eldritch roots, positive rumors spread. It was said that the Empire would help the companies against the orcs and goblins. The Empire would stop the bloodshed by the orcs and keep the dead in their graves. All of which were jobs that the halflings did not particularly enjoy. Thus, the Empire of Yonda "conquered" Riga in 189 A.D., after the melting of the snow first drowned the entire supply train of the Imperials in the Reik. After that, the soldiers were even still supplied by the halflings and taught how to fight the goblins. Finally, in spring with the end of winter, Alla "fell". Barely 10,000 soldiers had been sent. No one expected resistance on either side. The 10,000 soldiers were divided into the smaller towns and villages after the unresisting occupation.

Emperor Justizian, thereby gained a high popularity on both sides in the short term. The imperial soldiers were thus able to gradually supplement and replace the Halfling mercenary troops. In doing so, the addition of imperial soldiers and weapons showed an uncanny effectiveness against goblins and the orcs, who did not want to integrate into the imperial army. The mercenary companies were naturally pleased to find their friends, brothers and sisters not half-eaten as bone trophies or decapitated at the entrances of goblin tribal caves.

 

Since the "conquest" of Yondalla, 34 winters have passed and the companies now consist of hardened halfling fighters who, due to the loss of tradition of their task, blame the Empire for subjugating them unfairly. in 224 A.D. Riga, a small force trained in eldritch martial arts gained the commander status of the halfling companies, which were slowly losing their importance. This force called itself "Sickle Dragon" and vowed to wipe out goblins and orcs once and for all. This association of Halfling mercenaries, about 8000 strong, however, aroused the Emperor Justizian, who was already old at that time, to demand the disbandment of the troop, since the Imperial Army had everything under control. This did not happen, however, as the "Sickle Dragon" ignored the request. At first, the people of Yondalla did not care, whether small or big hotheads thought they could take credit for the elimination of orcs or goblins.

However, over the years, when Justizian, according to evil tongues, should not have ruled physically and mentally anymore, the fronts hardened and everyone thought to poach in the other's area of responsibility. When in 235 Riga, nine years after the founding of the "Sickle Dragon", there was a clash in Alla, in which about two dozen imperial soldiers and only a dozen halflings were killed, the Empire wanted to put the thumbscrews on and show Yondalla who calls the shots in the Protectorate.

The new emperor Gadion then dispatched some 15,000 soldiers in 236 A.D. Riga to disarm the rebellious "children's troops." This succeeded only to a limited extent, however, because the Sichelrache decided to divide its troops. Thereupon the Yondalese started the well-known "haystack hunt". The imperial soldiers combed through village after village in Yondalla, only to be welcomed with hospitality again and again.

The sequence of events was usually similar: a troop of the Sickle Dragon marched through a village, was warmly received, ate, rested, drank, harassed and mobbed the resident priest, imprisoned the resident imperial soldiers, released the latter upon departure, and then moved on. Usually about a week later, the imperial hunting company found the village full, was likewise supplied by the local halflings, and then moved on with a rebuke to the residents for not supplying the insurgents.

When troops caught up, on the short distances where horseback was actually faster, the Sickle Dragon mercenaries were placed and imprisoned to be taken away to Yonda. The problem was that the more halflings the empire imprisoned, the more resistance grew among the population. Thus the problem never became smaller, while the Sichelrache used the whole action to become popular among the population of Yondalla.

After several years in which three commanders of the imperial army had made fools of themselves, Emperor Gadion finally decided to declare the action "successfully finished" in 239 A.D. Riga. As a result, the Sickle Dragon had many branches and was once again more popular than the Emperor's "fat, bald-headed armor men". The empire was able to recruit the orcs and thus solve, or at least minimize, the problem of man-eaters, while the Sickle Dragon took care of goblins.

The situation in Yondalla calmed down and a flourishing period of cooperation began, which lasted until the death of Emperor Gadion in 321 A.D. Riga, the emperor who ruled for almost a hundred years.

After this time, however, the relationship changed. Due to the slow decline of the Empire, corrupt bureaucrats and skirmishes with elves, Rah Kari and eldritch princes, the demands of the Empire became successively higher. This caused the Sickle Language to regain importance for the first time in decades. Suddenly, the Sickle Language stood for fighting the "obesity of the Empire, which can no longer cultivate its fields." Corruption of the Empire was criticized and relentlessly and accurately exposed in the "Equality Amendment" in 368 A.D. Riga and sent directly to Civis Primae to be presented with a troop of envoys from Yondalla. The "Equality Amendment" was noted by the Emperor and promises were made to act against corruption and laziness, but nothing happened. It is believed that the empire, which was spending more and more time and resources on warlike campaigns, no longer had the resources to solve the problem.

As a result, there was an uprising in Yondalla. In particular, the major cities of Yonda and Alla were outraged and chased imperial bureaucrats and incompetent priests of the ecclesia out of the villages. This, of course, affected only the corrupt, lazy and all overweight.

 

Neither the ecclesia, which monopolistically claimed the disposal of the dead and had banned other forms of corpse disposal, nor the empire were pleased with this move. It led to new imperial soldiers being sent again. A large batch of 5,000 soldiers in Yonda and about 2000 soldiers in Alla. This time, however, it was taken as an affront by the halflings. The Yondalese saw them as perpetuating a stupid system if corruption was not dealt with. This led to resentment in the village assemblies. The ecclesia reacted, typically ponderously, to anything that did not scream heresy and wanted to maintain the status quo.

However, since the representatives of the empire lived like maggots in Yondalla's bacon, it was extremely difficult to get the representatives away from there.

The Sickle Dragon eventually took justice into its own hands, imprisoning and rarely killing representatives of the Imperial Army or the Ekklesia. This led to a split in support for the Sickle Dragon among the halfling population. The imperial bureaucrats blamed, in addition to the sickle dragon, the "depravity" of the keepers of the resting places of the Ekklesia. The Fathers, on the other hand, saw the sickle dragon and the overweight soldiers of the Empire, who were accused of having "the discipline of city elves," as the source of the problems. The Empire then tried to attack the Sickle Dragon this time and hanged representatives who resisted. This led to bitter resistance from the Sickle Dragon and a descent into guerrilla warfare against Imperial groups that were in stark contradiction to the autonomy of the villages and towns.

At the same time, although it was not possible to convince the entire population of the teachings of the Allgod, about 30% of the population of Yondalla believed that the Ekklesia was important and correct, also due to the elimination of the problem of the dead.

These skirmishes and quarrels made the orcs and goblins, for centuries in insignificance for the stability of Yondalla, take courage and start again to harass Yondalese more strongly.

The villages west of the river Odrian were repeatedly attacked by orcs from about 380 A.D. Riga. Thereby the village Odris with several hundred inhabitants was strongly affected by a coordinated attack of orcs.

> *"We celebrated, as usual at new moon after the council meeting and ate all the amenities. Wistian, the village leader even brought marzipan from Yonda, and we drank properly, as befits decent halflings, and some of our own perhaps drank a little too much. But that was nothing special. That's how we were, after all, we had negotiated and written down the contracts until the middle of the night. Everyone then set off to get back to their houses, our wives don't like to wait forever with the kids either. The next morning, the children and the younger ones were up, the orcs came. In broad daylight! The audacity. In the old days of the rolling company, you could lie alone in the forest at night and neither orc nor goblin could be seen or heard. They came, there must have been about 50 orcs. I mean, our village had about 900 inhabitants, but a little drunk, without combat experience and other it was pure slaughter of our brothers and sisters. The stronger of us, thanks to the vengeance sickle had at least some training and the crossbow was still under the bed of some overcautious brothers. But I swear to God, no one really expected such a thing. The old people only told the scary stories to the children, that they would be good and well-behaved and at least come back to the house before dark. But then there they were. Mud-brown mountains of flesh, guaranteed 2 meters high and each as strong as an ox. They carried iron swords, and shields with the emblem of the empire painted on them. They smashed the doors to our houses with their hammers, and the thinner orcs chased those who wanted to escape through the back door. We didn't stand a chance with our short legs, the god didn't put us on this earth for that. Anyone who resisted and posed a threat was summarily beaten to death or slashed open. I could accommodate my family and the Odsensen with me in the cellar under the trap door and with the carpet and the table you did not see us. But God, the screams of the children, wives and fathers as they were simply slain like fish on land. Within a few hours the haunting was over, the orcs gone. They left none of their own behind. The next few days we all left the village and tried to find shelter in the next small town
>
> *But the worst thing was not that the orcs slaughtered ours like cattle, but that neither the padre nor his death guards did anything against the orcs. And those damned full-figured imperial soldiers. The orcs just locked you in their guard hut, because they were eating and playing cards again, as usual. "Nothing will happen", "the emperor has everything under control", "calm down child, there are no more orcs here".  If I could, I would have chased those lazy bastards out of our village. But I think that neither the Father nor the imperial soldiers really tried to fight for us
>
> *We contacted the imperial representatives in Yonda and asked for a purge of orcs. For two weeks nothing happened. Not even a reply, no representative on horseback or on foot. Nothing. We then contacted the sickle dragon after 3 weeks. 1 week later there were 400 trained Sichelrache mercenaries. Interviewed the survivors, organized replacements of 'food and destroyed and stolen property and then left 5 days after arriving. You should have seen that, how those fat imperial no-goods suddenly saw how a group is organized militarily. 3 days later the troops came back, much smaller, but with 3 sacks full of orc heads. They got the padre and his no-goods and went back, buried and buried the deceased and returned two days later.*
>
> *And how did the imperial ones in Yonda react? Imprisoned OUR people for allegedly taking vigilante action, abusing the Father, which is bullshit, and then attacking "citizens of the Empire. "* > >And how did the imperials in Yonda react?
>
> *After that, neither new guards of the imperial army came to our village, nor a new priest. Only the sickle dragon did not venture west of the Odrian River again, and our village was alone again. This is exactly why we should have resisted the annexation. This empire is gluttonous and will perish on itself, and I will be damned if, even if, the emperor shows up here personally. "*
>
> Report of a halfling about the orc attack and its consequences

 

Such stories with a similar tenor became more frequent over the years thereafter and the once so peaceful Yondalla then had to struggle with such problems.

 

Since 368. n. Riga such conflicts strengthened again and again. Despite the 58 years since the "Equality Amendment", no solution could be found to this problem, as all sides thought they were already doing their best and the other side was blocking them.

Nowadays it can be said that the city of Yonda is pacified and there is nothing to fear at night, neither as a human nor as a halfling. In Alla, however, things are different, goblins, sickle dragons, a small established imperial nobility, the fanatics of the Ekklesia and swelling gang criminality destabilize the city. South of the Reik, there is a tendency to loot imperial supply trains, north of the Reik there are orc and goblin raids and a poorly organized imperial army that can't get a handle on the problems caused by the expulsion of the Sickle Dragon.

Nevertheless, some of Yondalla's villages were hit by the consequences of the war, as newly won - as well as previously owned lands were completely devastated by the wars. This left them no choice but to temporarily farm other fields and leave their previous location behind for the time being.

## The Society of Race

Halflings are known for their love of consumer goods, such as fancy drinks or fine cheeses. They value celebration, music, and culinary delights more than war and heroic deeds, but are not averse to money and belongings.

The people of Yondalla tend to settle in small villages, as their laid-back nature means that large industries are a very unusual thing. However, a large city has been established. Endeldor - also called the "Heart of Yondalla" - seduces with its large spice plantations and festivals at every corner. Endeldor is also the only place in Yondalla where trade with other races is conducted on a large scale.

In the smaller villages of Yondalla, it is customary for the people to elect a representative. This representative is called "Elder" and is responsible for communication and trade between his village and other villages, or the capital Endeldor. He also coordinates a small citizen army for defense and its cooperation with the imperial troops.

Although it is in the nature of Hablings to display charismatic traits and generally a cheerful nature, this is not the case for everyone in Yondalla. Some halflings have taken it upon themselves to explore the lands of Orbis Astea or to protect their lands from monsters and other evil creatures. These halflings are known among their brethren as "grizzled", as their priorities are quite different from the standard carefree culture.

### Race Relations

Due to the geographic location of Yondalla, the halflings have very rarely been involved in any sort of warfare. This is largely because only two other races have direct geographic contact with Yondalla - the Empire to the north and some goblin tribes to the west. Although the halflings initially fared poorly against the goblin tribes, it didn't take long for them to realize that they could ease the tension between the two races with a little charismatic wit. Even though goblins are known as creatures who do not get along well with other sentient beings, the halflings have managed to hold an annual celebration for nearly a hundred years to show their appreciation for the other small race of Aestea.

The Empire has acted as Yondalla's big brother since trade between the two groups began. As a token of appreciation for the protection the soldiers of the Heartland have afforded the halflings of Yondalla from fierce creatures and other threats, a trade in the finest spices and herbs grown right in the heart of "Endeldor" took place. These ingredients are readily consumed by nobles, Civis Primae, and other great households in the surrounding regions, and are known by other races to be a true delight, but are rarely found outside of the Heartland and Yondalla.

Although halflings are considered the most cheerful race in Orbis Astea, there are the curmudgeons who ensure that even among halflings there are characters who experience quite a bit. By not seeking the innocent pleasures of life, the Curmudgeons have the opportunity to abuse the general trust that many other races place in them. Some see this as an opportunity and hire them for specific tasks such as infiltration or persuasion of other noble families or corporations.

Due to the fact that halflings often do not appear suspicious, many of the grizzled have joined the ranks of Imperial Intelligence and spies for the Empire. These halflings have often helped the Empire in significant ways. For example, they helped convince the armies of Eldria that the main force of their enemies was marching on Austen. This act of persuasion caused Eldria to lose the war, which also caused some Eldrian nobles to be less than sympathetic to halflings.

## The Legends of the Race

Endeldra was the founder of "Endeldor", the forerunner of Yondalla, and the one who undertook the initial friendly communication with the Empire. He was also the one who united most of the villages of Yondalla.

## The proper terms of the race

**Ironvale**: Village representatives who are sent to the cities to discuss major issues. Serve as representatives.

**Bror**: Translated, this word means big brother, as the human race has many physical similarities to the halflings, except for size. Due to the fact that the Empire has protected them from most enemies, many halflings have begun to refer to humans as their big brothers as a way of showing their appreciation for their neighbors.

**Grudge**: Halflings who live a more aggressive lifestyle. They serve in mercenary companies, serve in the imperial army, or travel the world to tell tales of adventure.

## Individual characteristics of the halflings

Unobtrusive: Due to their innocent and charismatic nature and their small size, they are very often not suspected by most people. This can be used to unobtrusively sabotage the lives of others, or simply follow them around town without attracting attention.
