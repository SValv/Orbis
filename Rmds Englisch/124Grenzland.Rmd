# The borderland

![Map of Borderland](Pictures/Maps/Borderland.jpg)
XXXXXXXX General remarks on unification:
- Empire or empire?
- Awakened or *awakened
- 


The Borderlands is the Empire's outer border with Eldria, and thus one of the regions that can match the bloody past of a war zone. Due to past conflicts, Awakened are more common there than in the Heartland, and local garrisons often have to mobilize forces to shield cemeteries, crypts, and former battlefields to the point that any transport routes are safe.
This is because these aforementioned transportation routes are one of the most important features of the borderlands. In fact, the Borderland represents the safest route to Eldria, as the shorter route goes through the [Silva Nacia](#RegionSilvaNacia), which is known not to be the safest route due to elven activity.

## Villages of the region

### Lugnux

XXXX Revise XXXX
- similar to the above, the contents of the sentences convey little information, or are too similar to the sentences before them.

Lugnux is the biggest city in Grenzland and serves as an important trade point in the region with a lot of trafic going through the city. Many people from the region come to the city to trade their goods and find capable manpower. Grenzland is not known for being the safest region, which has led many people from the countryside to move to the city in the last years in search for a place to settle down. Many of the districts are relatively new and some people even decide to live in tents in the outskirts of the city.

Halfings often travel to the city and sell their unique products for a good price in this city, such as alcohol, which is highly sought after in the region. However in the last few years the city has encountered many problems related to alcohol and drunkards. Districts are filled with empty bottles of yondalla alcohol and the almost lifeless people who lost their lives to alcohol because of the high addictiness and potency of yondalla drugs and various products. The city has tried to solve these problems, however the merchandise from the neibhouring region has become a central part of Lugnux's economy and it has become ever harder to fix these complications without damaging their own ecocomy.

nonetheless Lugnux has other redeeming qualities such as the many craftsmen that provide the region high quality goods ranging from pottery, wine-making, artisans and mercenaries who will accept any task

Owners: 110.000

### Arx Libertas

Arx Libertas' history is deeply connected with the Red Shock Battle, as the city's founder Laurenz Mox Julianus was the soldier that managed to flee the battlefield with the banner of the then third legion. Julianus eventually led a resistance after the battle against Eldria and founded the city. Nowadays the city greatly evolves around the Mercenary guild and its HQ, which can be found in the city. Mercenaries can be found in almost every street and bar and they serve an important role in the region. The citizens of Grenzland can't always rely on the Empire's soldiers to solve the many problems that can be found in the region, ranging from clearing undead to killing goblins.

The city also has an impressive amount of blacksmiths and war supplies. It is said that you can even find illegal equipment and hardened steel if you have enough money. As a results, many adventures travel to the Arx Libertas to gear up and prepare for their adventure.

Owners: 55,000


### Orb Latar

Orb Latar is the last city of the empire before entering Eldria and is the new gem of the region. It is right at the edge of the two regions and functions as a stronghold and blockgade to Eldria and its forces. However despite this gloomy reality, Orb Latar is a festive city. It is hard to pinpoint how the city became so merry, but it has a long history of friendly festivals where people from Eldria and the Empire meet up to celebrate.

The city is also known for its wine and other fine alcohol as well as its extensive wine-fields. Orb Latar both produces and consumes a lot of food and alcohol and somehow it always have enough for a spontaneous festival. Many world renowned brands such as Kenkensen, Berrin and Sma-bl√§ also come from the city.

Inhabitants :90.000

### Infrastructure

Grenzland only has a few roads, which are well kept. These included the roads that originate from Herzland and lead to Eldria. These roads are the safest as many troops use them when traveling from the two regions and they play an important role in the Empire since they offer the safest way to Eldria. However the undead can be found everywhere in the region and one should always be prepared to encounter them. Most of the other roads in the region are well-worn from the conflicts of the region. Some small village repair their roads close to them but the majority them are in poor condition.

## The history of the region

### The Battle of Klyln Field

XXXX Revise XXXX
- If events are simultaneous, they need to be told that way and not the result of one and then the other - here I have a hard time following who is doing what and why?
- please decide if Empire should be written in upper or lower case (consistent spelling)

The borderlands have had their share of bloody conflicts and wars, as they have often been the battleground for many clashes between the Empire and the powers of Eldria. Both sides kept fighting over the land for many years. In the beginning of the conflict there were mainly just small skirmishes as both factions were getting to know each others strengths but as time passed the battles grew bigger and bigger.
One of the battles, which shaped the early history of Grenzland, was the battle of Klyln field. Klyln field was an important passage in between the mountains of Grenzland. The empire believed that they could send the third legion through this field as they believed that the goblins, that used to live there, had wandered away. However Eldria leaked false information to the empire in order to get them to fall into their trap. Eldria's forces were waiting for the third legion and ambushed it from both sides of the field. The annihilation of the third legion left Grenzland very vulnerable and for a time Eldria ruled over most of the region.
However some soldiers of the third legion managed to survive the battle and split up into multiple groups and after some time they managed to build resistance groups with the help of the locals. A surviving soldier, called Laurenz Mox Julianus, managed to flee the battle of Klyln field with the banner of the third legion and he became the leading symbol of the resistance. His resistance was financed by the empire and also secretly from the Guardian Cult (XXXX WHY?). The Guardian Cult made a deal with the resistance fighters, which would enable them to use the Mercenary guild, which was later established in the city of Arx Libertas, to hide their spies and agents in the land of the empire. During the war, the resistance faction created the city of Arx Libertas. Arx Libertas was founded close to Yondalla because it blocked the main route to Yondalla in Grenzland. This passage to Yondalla was the only second route to the empire's land. (XXXX WHY DOES THE RESISTANCE BLOCK THE WAY TO THE EMPIRE WHICH FINANCES IT?). The city came under attack many times by Eldria's forces but the city always survive because of the brilliant tactics of Julianus. Ones the Empire regained control of the region it signed a contract with the resistance fighters. The Empire was given the land and loyalty of the various resistance groups in Grenzland but the Resistance leaders were made into lords with great autonomy. They were allowed to keep their soldiers in their armies and raise their own taxes. After this the importance of Arx Libertas grew weaker because it no longer held its important political reach over the empire. After time the mercenary guild was founded in Arx Libertas and wowadays the guild can be found in every mayor town of Grenzland.

### The Red Shock Battle

A clash during the war was the "Red Shock Battle" in 188. The princes of Eldria were preparing to move their forces to the Borderlands to strengthen their dominance in the region. However, the Empire had infiltrated spies into Eldria's ranks who betrayed their plans.
With this information, the Empire sent its own troops into the region to ambush the rival armies and seize control of the region. In this battle, the Empire unveiled one of the secret weapons, the "Hammerers of Old Griffin City". It was the first time that the armies of Eldria encountered these forces and consequently they had a massive impact on the battle. This was because they were specialized in effectively eliminating the knights of Eldria (XXXX CROSSREFERENCE). The battle ended with a decisive victory for the Empire. Even though this was not the last battle between the two powers, it was one of the important martial confrontations that decided the war in favor of the Empire.

### The Qirrik Hills Battle

Another infamous battle that led to one of the most horrific times in the Borderlands was the Battle of Qirrik Hills. Here, too, the forces of Eldria and the Empire faced each other. But this battle was not at all like many others before it.
Both powers suffered great losses, but in the end Eldria emerged victorious.
Despite their victory, they were in enemy territory and were left with only a handful of soldiers who were without commanders. Sadly, the soldiers had to make the dishonorable decision to leave the battlefield without caring for the dead. This decision led to the creation of what is now known as the "Decayed Hills of Qirrik".  After not too long, the borderlands were invaded by an entire army of Awakened. For many weeks, the lives of the borderlanders were threatened by the invasion of the Awakened. It took the combined forces of the 7th Legion and the troops stationed in the Borderlands to defeat the Awakened army.
Awakened always stood out as a major problem in the course of the battles. Often, the survivors were unable to properly bury the fallen soldiers, so many bodies were left unattended.

(I think Kasper wrote some lore about the Goblins in Borderland, but I can't find it. It would be good if we still write the story about the goblins in Borderland XXXX)

## Economic situation

### The resources of the region

The rocky and hilly terrain of the borderland makes normal farming very difficult. Because of this, the region lives primarily on livestock. As a result, the Borderlands produces a large amount of pelts and furs each year. The furs range from mink skins to goat skins. Anyone who wanders the borderland will most likely come across several fur producers who specialize in certain animals.

Another resource that is widely available in the borderlands is wood - more specifically, firewood. Due to the peculiar climate and changing temperatures in the Borderlands, most wood in the region is not strong enough to be used in large buildings or ships. For this reason, people in the Borderlands have chosen to do business in firewood and charcoal. The charcoal business has become so significant that over half of the Heartland's charcoal is imported from the Borderlands. The only resource problem facing the Borderlands is ores and salts. Although there are some strange ores in the Borderlands, their usefulness has not yet been found out and why they are useless.

## Sociopolitical situation

Due to the rather desolate situation of the Borderland, many young adults migrate towards the Heartland. There, the economic opportunities in the big cities are much better and more promising than those that the small and medium-sized towns of the Borderland can offer. This shortage of young people is having an impact both economically and militarily. (XXXX IN WHAT FORM, FOR EXAMPLE)

The undead have been a major problem for a long time in Grenzland although a lot is being done to combat the undead. This includes, among other things, the calling of the Order of the Cleansing. Yet the citizens of the region still fear to travel the roads as they might be attacked by the undead.

### The Order of the Cleansing

The Order of the Cleansing was founded with the sole purpose of cleansing the lands of the Borderlands of the Awakened, who are like a plague. The Order was founded shortly after the victory over the Awakened Army of the Qirrik Hills. The Empire knew that if it wanted to take over the region and build an infrastructure, it had to make sure that the Awakened would no longer be a problem. The Order is made up of soldiers who specialize in destroying Awakened. As such, they always carry equipment for burying the dead. They can be recognized by their symbol, which is a flower under a radiant sun. The Order even has special relations with the Church, being a subdivision of the Ekklesia. However, one of the Order's biggest problems is that it simply does not have enough troops to fight larger groups of Awakened (for example, after a large battle). That's why they often replenish their ranks with veterans from the mercenary guild. Of course, they pay them with money. However, their main payment is that the Order uses its political influence, exerted by the Church, to protect members of the Guild from legal consequences.  

### Ruling System/Organization

## Climatic conditions

Grenzland shares a very similar climate to Herzland. The weather is very mild through the first half of the year. The regions has enough rain to grow crops adequately and plenty of clear sky in the summer.

### The flora and fauna

#### Monsters in the region

Monsters such as Kathakans, Werewolfs, Gravis and many different Vampiridae can be found in the region, however the region is mainly dominated by the undead.

## Rumors of the region

### The executioner of Pikliven

XXXX Revision XXXX

History has shown us that in times of conflict and war, neighbors, friends, and even family members often turn on each other because of the crisis they are facing. Some people even see these crises as opportunities to pursue their own malicious intentions. One such person was the executioner of Pikliven.  No one knows his true identity or where he came from. Many speculate that he is a former centurion of the Empire who harbors a great hatred for Eldria. Some say he is a retribution executioner sent by the All God to punish the people of the Borderlands for the countless wars between the factions. The Executioner is depicted as a tall, gray-clad man with a modified man-catcher, capable of decapitating even the best of knights. The Executioner of Pikliven was first sighted in 207 after the Battle of Krissweg when he collected the heads of dead soldiers. It is said that the cries of the decapitated souls could be heard hanging from his waist, calling for help. 7 years after his first appearance, a farmer in Pikliven reported that he heard people screaming in agony under the ground. Later it turned out that they were the decapitated heads, which were probably stuck in the ground by the executioner of Pikliven. Even today, the screams of the executioner's victims can be heard when driving through the Pikliven countryside.


(XXXX HERE STILL PICTURE OF TYPE - ARTWORK BITCH!)


## The lost city Ferinstill
XXXX Revision
- Complete the marked parts


The history of Ferinstill begins with its founder, the Kishiv family. The Kishiv family rose to prominence after the decline of the "SLova" families in Eldria. Although they had previously managed several farms in Eldria, the Kishivs rose to prominence after the "Slova" family lost power, introducing new technologies in the agricultural field. Finally, in the year "177", the leader of Aerlham officially appointed the head of the Kishiv family, Hostus Sai Kishiv, to spearhead agricultural progress in Eldria's relatively new region, the Borderlands. The strange fauna and ecosystem of the Borderlands fascinated Hostus, so he decided to establish his new headquarters amidst the forests and mountains of the Borderlands, which eventually became the city of Feringstill.

Although it was initially difficult for the family to settle in the borderlands and build an economy based on the various products of the region, the difficult part of their story was not over.  After a few years, numerous migrants, hoping for new opportunities, came to the borderland, and consequently thousands of new mouths had to be fed in the region. A task that the Kishiv family took upon itself. However, this task proved particularly difficult, as the family simply could not plant enough crops and feed livestock with their current technology and infrastructure. They tried everything they could think of, even if it meant stepping into morally gray areas. They tried to discover new edible plants and food sources, which resulted in many citizens dying from poisoning. They tried to crossbreed different vegetables and plants, which resulted in several harvests yielding inedible food.

Soon the family was confronted with the harsh reality of the situation.  Despite their best efforts, they were unable to feed the many people in the borderlands. In 189, not many days after another bad harvest, a letter arrived from Aerlham. The princes of Eldria were gearing up for a new war, and Kishiv was tasked with providing enough food for the troops.

>Know that you have limits, my sons. At the end of the day, we are human. Nothing more, nothing less. Although God has given us His form and His gifts, we are not Him. Our people may see us as a family without boundaries, but we are not. Even though we have achieved great things in the past, we cannot always do so. Remember this, my sons, and when the day comes that you are confronted with our ridiculous reality, you will not suffer as I have.
>
> --- Hostus to his 2 sons

XXXX Revision
- Linguistically still quite weak - 1:1 deepl translation, many wrong terms, incomprehensible sentence structures
- I find it hard to see the thread of the story --- the whole story is supposed to be mysterious

In this dire time when Kishiv's shining grace was waning, redemption came in the form of her second son Atin Curius Kishiv. For Atin was chosen for a journey into the wilderness of the Borderlands, which still held many secrets waiting to be discovered by Eldria. ( Atin was a curious child and he would often travel into the mountains and forest of Grenzland in order to discover and unravel any mysterious that could help his family)
/
Moreover, since he was the second son, many of the family's duties were shifted to his older brother, so Atin had a lot of time to himself. When he returned from his trip to the mountains one evening, he seemed even more exhausted and worn out than usual, and hurried to his father with good news. Apparently he had found a way to harvest more than they could ever hope for. He had found a way to restore the honor and glory of their family. The next day, accompanied by their bodyguards, they both ventured into the wilderness and returned to their country estate after many hours, but strangely enough, the father was missing one eye, // (but his other eye was filled with hope)
. The next day, the eldest son Martin Vetious Kishiv was ordered to ride to Aerlham and personally deliver a letter to the family announcing that enough food would be ready for the prince's army and two others. After many months, Martin rode back to the borderlands, accompanied by many army officials, but something was wrong. After leaving the main road leading to "Orb Latar", they saw more and more moss and roadside wherever they looked. Martin's heartbeat increased and with it the fear for his family, and this fear was not unjustified. When they arrived in Feringstill, there was not a soul to be seen, but there was no sign of any fighting either. Every building was overgrown with the flora of the borderlands. It was as if the town had been left to its own devices for decades. The group tried to look for clues as to what had happened, but there was nothing to be found. There was no human trace anywhere, except for the tools of the people lying on the ground and the plates and cups that were on the tables.

To this day, no historian has managed to find out what really happened in Feringstill, and there are only theories without solid proof. However, Martin Vetious Kishiv, the town's only survivor, has spent his life searching for answers. Although he found no evidence of what happened, his descendants are still trying to find out the truth about the disappeared town of Feringstill.

### The dead man wanderer

XXXX Revise XXXX
- Maybe give a little more context here - but written okay in itself
- You could make a bigger mystery about him not being attacked - so the whole thing seems quite understating and rather boring, but quite nice to see it if you happen to see him
--> idea that there are people, like the cult, who find/have found this "ability" exciting for their own work
- Time in which he lives, is that relevant?

It is a known fact that there are a lot of undead in Grenzland that appeared after the many battles during the war. Some bodies were returned home and some families are still looking for the body of their family members years after. However there are rumours of one person who can be found near the battlefields. For normal people this would be a deathtrap since there is a high chance that you would be attacked by undead. However people have sighted a man wandering next to the undead. The man somehow doesn't get attacked by them. They simply walk past him. Many theories exist about why he doesn't get attacked by the undead. Some people say that he is an undead himself. Other people believe that he is and agent of the devil. But one thing that the people who have spotted him can agree upon is that this man is looking for someone who died long ago as they can hear him mumbling "It is alright Theresa. I'll soon find you and then you won't be alone anymore". People have started to call him the dead man wanderer. He can even be found in Lugnux sometimes if you happen to be in the city during the right time but most people are afraid to approach him. However some fools have tried to follow him the ones he leaves the city because they want to understand the mystery behind the man but all of them never return from the battelfield they go with him.

These units of the Imperial Army specialized in armor-breaking weapons early on in order to fight the Eldritch Knights more effectively. They are the seen as the proud sons of Grenzland ever since the Red Shock battle .They often march through the cities and towns of Grenzland and inspire the people.
