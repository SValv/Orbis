Simon is the founder, the brain and the dad of the project. He sees to it that the table is abundantly covered with possibilities, that everyone has the chance to bring in their own ideas. He puts by far the most love, sweat and "tears" into the creation of the story, as well as the automation of the gameplay. He likes to motivate the team again and again to take on a new task, so that the project can grow and develop depth.
In all sessions and private conversations he integrates the mentioned ideas against the overall background of our world. Because nobody knows the Orbis Astea as well as he does! Therefore an idea, which is to be taken up into our world, must pass his critical eyes. Since he has especially in mind that no one can get advantages in history and everything finds its just place. However, he is always open for discussions and explanations why a new idea could be an enrichment for Orbis Astea.
Simon is also the brain of the group. Especially when it comes to rules or automating processes (so the program that calculates and evaluates all the rolls is from him), he becomes particularly ambitious, because you can automate the process of DMing more and more and thus really focus the gameplay experience InCharacter. His biggest opponent: the Run Times.
However, aside from all the will to work and spur the group on, there's one thing he never forgets: it's all about the fun the InGame characters can have together on their adventures.
It is his creativity, his heart and soul and his discipline that drive the project forward at full speed.

Emil is completely absorbed in the design of our great maps. With great attention to detail and in constant updates, he implements the new lore in the maps, which once again makes the world much more tangible and vivid as a participating character. The visually beautiful design of the world rounds out the gaming experience.
His faithful soul is part of every lore session that is held. He asks critical questions and thus additionally promotes the accurate further development of our lore, as well as the game mechanics. In addition, he develops new lore - especially in the area of animali.

Kasper has been a strong advocate and supporter of the project from the beginning. Especially in the beginning of the development of our world, he contributed many ideas and had a significant impact on the design of Orbis. His areas of expertise currently lie in the development of further lore, as well as his position as side DM. Especially through this function he helps a lot, because in this way he allows Simon the necessary time out and enjoyment of the game through his own character play. Especially to mention is that he is willing to work himself into many areas and to bring an incredible enthusiasm to the table.

Flo is a bit of the second all-rounder in the group. He has an eye for what might be great joy, or relief, to the in-game characters on their journey. Through him there is a lot of food for thought on how to improve the game on the run.
His supreme discipline, however, is the rulebook, which he regularly expands with new ideas and here provides many impulses for discussions, improvements and new developments.
The past of the dwarves are also a big point, which gets his attention.

Due to his background as a biologist, he has many ideas for plants that accompany us inGame on our journeys and create many new possibilities that go far beyond the creation of normal healing potions. He also likes to dedicate himself to the development of monsters, the Misty Grove and different orc tribes, as well as their history. His motto could be called "The more vile the creature, the better!".
At Lore Sessions he does not hold back with criticism and ideas for new decisions. Here, too, the biological background finds its way in again and again, as it comes to one or the other fact-check, which enables the group to keep a certain relation to reality.
