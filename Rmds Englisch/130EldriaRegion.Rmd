## Villages of the region

Since most of the principalities have already been described in the [Eldria article](#EldriaFaction), here are the links to the respective principalities. Those that have not yet been described in detail are described below:

-   [Aearlham](#Aerlham)
-   [Ghent](#Gent)
-   [Darcy](#Darcy)
-   [Calvert](#Calvert)
-   [Austen](#Austen)
-   [Hasting](#Hasting)
-   [Rintom and Haag](#Rintom%20and%20Haag)

### Statton

Statton was once a separate principality under the Reindell family, but 500 years ago it was conquered by Aerlham, and since then Statton and its environs have been under Aerlham's control. Rumor has it that the entire Reindell family was put to the sword.
The area around Statton used to be one of the most peaceful parts of Eldria, as it was far away from the main points of conflict in Eldria and was geographically secured by Aerlham. However, this changed after the Empire's attack on Eldria.

As part of the Imperial occupation, one of the largest Imperial fortresses was built near the city of Statton - Fort Eldirana - this base is both one of the largest training facilities and the largest collection of served troops in Eldria. Reportedly, more than two [legions](#ImperialArmy) of the Empire are stationed at Fort Eldriana.
As the fort trains both Eldrian young men - who are more loyal to Eldria - and young soldiers from other regions of the Empire - who in turn are, of course, loyal to the Empire.

The large number of soldiers in the fort naturally also ensures large groups of drunken soldiers who go drinking and partying in Statton at the end of work or on free weekends. This ensures that the prostitution industry in Statton has grown faster than any other service - and with it the organized crime that does not let the chance to get a lot of money simply pull.With this, of course, other types of crime such as drug trafficking and gang fights increase.

In Statton it is not uncommon to see street fights between criminal gangs, the city guard and drunken imperial soldiers, who are either loyal to Eldria or the Empire and therefore increasingly at each other's throats. This enormous chaos in a formerly idyllic city - where almost every noble family owned weekend houses - quickly became a political issue between noble families and the emperor, who needs the support of these same families in order to rule Eldria.

To manage the chaos and avoid further diplomatic problems, the emperor hired mercenaries from the borderlands to support the city guards, who were given more rights - such as the permission to use force more quickly or to arrest people on suspicion. However, as you can imagine, these mercenaries quickly found their own wallets more important than the peace of the city - they quickly became corrupt and established themselves as the fifth faction disturbing the peace of the city. Statton, meanwhile, continues to slide - from the jewel of Aerlham to a city of sin and crime.


### Infrastructure

Eldria is known for being one of the best connected regions in the world. Almost every city and town is connected by a road leading to one of the major cities, and every city has a road leading to another. The largest and best developed road is the road from Aerlham to Ghent. These two principalities are the most important and strongest in Eldria, and so many people and goods travel between them throughout the year. The next safest and most guarded road is the one from Aerlham to "" (the city on the border between Eldria and Borderland). This road is traveled by many imperial soldiers, who often accompany transports bringing goods or people to the region. Another important destination, to which many roads lead, is Wandia. Wandia is a central part of Eldria and many people - and armies - travel there. However, although Wandia is a national landmark, it is far from safe. Many armies want to travel to the lost city, and it is not uncommon for two opposing armies to meet on the way there. Another important destination is the city of Darcy. It is known to every citizen in Eldria, as it is the home of the Church of Darcy and the Principality of Darcy. Darcy is the producer of Riddin oil, which is necessary for any burial if the person is buried in the manner of Darcy. Therefore, it is important that the riddin oil can be brought to every corner of Eldria, and accordingly, the infrastructure around Darcy is well developed.

Even though Eldria has many roads, they are not always the safest, because wars are often fought between the many principalities, causing much confusion: armies and mercenaries roam the land, and if you are on different sides, carelessness on the roads can lead to a quick death. Also, many bandits and other unsavory groups roam Eldria and attack people on the streets.

## The history of the region

### The Kingdom of Eldria

Exactly when Eldria came into being is a knowledge that has unfortunately been lost, though it is now believed that Eldria was a grand project of the ominous dwarven clan known as [the Thunder Guardians](#Thunder Guardians). Like the society of the Thunder Guardians, Eldria was a kingdom whose giant capital [Wandia](#Wandia) in its heyday was many times larger and more impressive than Atumpet and Civis Primae combined. Wandia was inhabited on the surface by the Eldrians and underground by the Dwarves, and in many ways was run jointly.

The ruler of Wandia was, as it were, also the ruler of all Eldria. He created the administrative structure and domains that today make up the nobility, principalities and vassal ladders. All united under the crown of Wandia.

In this golden age of Eldria - long before the Empire even existed - Eldria was arguably the strongest and greatest human empire Orbis Astea had ever seen. Through the Thunder Guard it flourished technologically and economically, through the Eldrian knight culture it became a military power, which was even able to establish diplomatic relations with the [Elves of Silva Nacia](#Thunder Guard) - a friendship that culminated in the Elves giving a seed of the sacred tree to the Wandia royal family. It was nothing short of a miracle that this seed sprouted in Wandia, and there sprouted the only offshoot of the sacred tree to this day. A miracle that united the elves and the kingdom of Eldrias in friendship.

The kingdom of Eldria was not very expansive and, outside of trade with the inhabitants of the lower steppes, had little contact with other - largely non-existent - human kingdoms.

The fall of the kingdom came with the fall of Wandia. When in the year [] an unusually large and powerful true dragon fell upon Wandia, turning the city into a pile of rubble. The Deep City was also destroyed by it, with many Thunder Guardians and the entire royal house of Eldria losing their lives.

### The Splintering {#SplinteringEldriaRegion}

Without the power of Wandia and the leadership of the King's House, the principalities of Eldria broke almost directly apart and the first Eldrian civil war broke out over power, territory, and resources. The unrest was further exacerbated by the True Dragon, who incinerated anything that came too close to Wandia, and the elves of Silva Nacia, who could not forgive the Eldrians for the loss of the Tree Sapling and now regularly invaded Eldria with their own troops.

Soon, two factions were able to prevail in the civil war. Aerlham in the north and Gent in the south of Eldria - the largest principalities of Eldria to this day.

In time, other local principalities also strengthened through clever exploitation of alliances and mutual backing. Thus Calvert, Austen, Darcy, Hasting, Rinton and Haag also became politically independent and relevant.

In the long run, all principalities managed to bind vassal lords and knights to themselves - some more, some less stably - and thus to consolidate their own power.

In the next centuries there were more and more civil wars in Eldria. This made the Eldrians more concerned with their internal disputes rather than external expansion, which is why there are no major campaigns of Eldria to report here. Ghent and Aerlham balanced each other out, and whenever it seemed that one of the principalities would be able to assert itself, the changing alliances of the smaller principalities corrected this, fearing that one of the sides would become too strong.

Around 950 before Riga, the so-called [Battle of the Colossi](#Thunder Guard) took place, which ensured that the true dragon could no longer terrorize Eldria.

### The effect of the rockfall

After several centuries, the rockslide of Istval occurred. A dwarven kingdom exploded and with it a part of the celestial peaks. The rivers and streams that were forcibly diverted as a result flowed into the valley and created the [Misty Grove](### Misty Grove) that separates the realm of Rah Kari from Eldria today.

Another effect of the rockslide was the devastation and largely destruction of the principalities south of Ghent. Large parts of Hague were destroyed, while other principalities sank completely. This was a great weakening of Ghent's position, since the affected principalities were largely vassals of Ghent.

As a result, Aerlham took the leading role among the principalities - although it cannot be equated with actual leadership. Aerlham is only the largest and most influential of the principalities, but the others follow only as far as they wish. Ghent is still enormously powerful and one of Aerlham's greatest adversaries.

However, Aerlham briefly occupied the home of the halflings - Yondalla - in 190 after Riga.

### The Imperial Occupation {#TheImperialOccupationEldrias}

For 8 years now, Eldria has been occupied by the Imperials. In the Battle of Aerlham, the Eldrian Grand Army was lost, a sort of assembled army of all the principalities. Although Eldria will not be able to recover from this blow anytime soon, the resistance against the Empire is omnipresent. While some parts of Eldria are in open rebellion, most have guerrilla organizations on the move trying to stop or hinder the Imperials. Still other lords are actively siding with the Empire in hopes of expanding their own position and power.

## Economic Situation

Eldria is a place with many rich cultures and diverse people, but because of all these factions and the many conflicts they have with each other, there is little room for continuous trade between different principalities. In addition, it is not uncommon for armies to burn villages and other trade facilities, which negatively affects trade and production in the region. For this reason, there are few large and important resource centers, but many smaller ones scattered throughout Eldria.

But anyone who has been a trading partner of a warring faction knows that war also creates many opportunities for the right people to get rich. Weapons and armor are among the largest markets in Eldria, and much of the economy is based on the manufacture, sale, and transportation of these goods. In addition, there are many areas around Austen where medicinal herbs are grown, which are important for making medicines and potions. Nevertheless, it seems that these regions can never produce enough products to meet Eldria's needs, and it often has to import medicines and herbs from other factions such as the Imperial Empire.


### The resources of the region

The resources that are most abundant and important in Eldria are wood, alchemy ingredients, furs, cloth. Eldria has a great fondness for hunting animals, and many people create assigned hunting grounds for nobles to use.
In Eldria, dedicated hunting grounds have even been established in the past for hunting. This practice is illegal today, but some nobles still seek the thrill of monster hunting. Therefore, monsters are often brought into the region from the Misty Grove or other distant areas and sold to the highest bidder.

While hunting is reserved for nobles, however, breeding and slaughtering animals is very common. Many people have farms for collecting leather and skins from animals in all parts of the region.

Not only monsters come to Eldria from the Misty Grove. The proximity also brings many diseases, and as if that wasn't enough, the many wars spread diseases like wildfire. To combat all this, the regions of Austen produce medicine and herbs for the people of Eldria who are struggling with diseases and ailments.

Eldria also has many forests that produce wood for buildings, fires, and other areas. Some of the most interesting woods are found around Austen. Here there are yellow, orange and red trees. These trees have a special appearance and characteristics and are loved by many nobles in Eldria.

## Sociopolitical position

Eldria is a vortex of political intrigue and war. Tensions can be found throughout the region. Be it the Empire and its soldiers trying to secure the region, the battle between Ghent and Aerlham, or even the tensions emanating from Silva Nacia and the Wood Elves. One thing is certain, however. If you are a noble in Eldria, there is never a moment of peace for you. War is the norm in Eldria, and many factions and principalities have a long history with each other that causes them to fight against each other, and no corner of the region is beyond the reach of sword and torch. Even when there are no visible wars, the constant struggle for power among the nobles is responsible for reducing the life expectancy in Eldria in one way or another.
The warring factions and nobles now determine most of the socio-political landscape of Eldria and cause most of the unrest in the region.

[Wandia](#Wandia) is the long-lost capital of Eldria, and its loss has always been a thorn in the side of the people of Eldria. As a result, many people - and especially nobles - dream of reclaiming the city from the monsters and the true dragon that now populate it. Many armies have tried in vain to take the city, and so it is still a topic of almost daily discussion.

Another important part of Eldria is the Silva Narcia and the wood elves that live in it and also other forests. Although most elves do not pose an immediate threat, they are a risk that Eldria's factions must constantly keep an eye on. In addition, it is not uncommon for walking tree monsters or spiders to come out of the forests and wreak havoc in Eldria.

## Climatic conditions

Overall, Eldria has a temperate climate. The weather is often mild, but there is great variation between seasons, yet it is rarely extremely hot or cold in the region.

### The flora and fauna

#### Monsters in the region

Eldria is probably one of the regions with the most monster encounters and victims - although this is more due to the population density than the sheer number of monsters. In the past it was even worse, as monsters were everywhere in the region, but early in Eldria's history people started hunting monsters. This phenomenon intensified after the fall of Harschell. Nowadays people still hunt monsters, especially knights often look for them to gain recognition and fame.

## Rumors of the region

### The green knight and the human beast

Throughout Eldria, there is a legend of two people who roam the land hunting monsters that no other fighter can defeat. This is the legend of the Green Knight, whose real name is unknown, and an Animalus named Satra Kra. These two fighters have been spotted in all corners of Eldria and have been observed fighting the most powerful beasts of Eldria. It is said that they are able to kill a werewolf with one shot.
Once a farmer observed them fighting Katakhan, where Satra Kra had his weapon stuck in the latter's back, as he was on fire. Satra Kra remained on Katakhan's back even as he swung furiously back and forth and from tree to tree until he finally fell to the ground dead. Another story tells that they killed a Gravis alone by luring the monster into an ingenious trap. Many people believe that these two people are the best monster hunters in all of Eldria.

### The Knight of the Red Death

Almost anyone who has dealt with Awakened knows how terrifying they can be. Especially if the Awakened is a knight, and it is well known that the Awakened Knights of Eldria are among the strongest Awakened you can encounter.
However, even among the Awakened Knights, there is one who stands out from the rest. Legend has it that a mighty Awakened Knight has roamed the land of Eldria for 107 years now. People believe that this knight was once a man named Soloman Schwertun. Soloman belonged to one of Eldria's ancient noble families, but was driven to ruin along with Soloman himself.
Rumors from over a hundred years ago said that the family and Soloman became involved with the dark arts and [the blood gods](#bloodcult) to gain more power. The family suddenly gained wealth and influence, but as quickly as they gained it, it disappeared. Many people sensed their involvement with the blood gods, and soon they were disregarded and disowned by the other families.

In the last years before his death, Soloman grew enormously in strength and size, becoming a ferocious warrior who was said to have no regard for human life. After his family lost their power, he swore revenge on all the people who had disowned his family. He managed to kill many people, but after a few years, the famous knight Joan Fraquis and his gang finally managed to kill him, but Soloman killed each of his opponents before succumbing to the injuries. Unfortunately, no one was able to bury the bodies, so after a short time Soloman became an undead knight. Since then, his dead body roams the lands, appearing randomly and killing mercilessly, and to this day no one has managed to rid the world of him.


## Sights

### Harschell

Harschell was once one of the largest cities in eastern Eldria since it was under the leadership of Lord Louis. However, after being attacked by an army of monsters 300 years ago, it lies in ruins. The ruined city is a testament to the hatred that many people in Eldria have for monsters, and since the city's collapse, many people have begun hunting monsters. People still live in the area, but the city has never returned to its former glory.

### The forest of Austen and its lands

Austen is located near a very special forest with yellow, orange and red trees. It is said that the forest is like a fairy tale, and most people are enchanted by its beauty. The trees are unlike anything they have ever seen, and many travel there just for the sight. The surrounding regions of Austen also produce many different herbs and materials for potions, and some of the most famous noble families who focus on and follow the art of medicine also live in these regions.

### Ulias Spooners Tavern

![Ulias Spooner](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Ulienus.jpg)

Ulias Spooner describes himself as a passionate performance drinker and bon vivant. With his love of fast horses and betting on the races of the same, he has made and gambled away several fortunes. Always with a good saying on his lips and a fresh ale at hand, his tavern is the favorite stop of many travelers, adventurers, fortune seekers and soldiers stationed in the area.
