# The character creation

In Orbis Astea offers a variety of possible stories, characters and possibilities. The most important question for creating a character is "What do you feel like doing?"

## The Excel file

Orbis Astea is a system in which the character, as well as tracking the development of that same character, is recorded in an Excel sheet. This can be downloaded from this website under "Download" in a blank version. In the following it will be explained how this character sheet is structured, which attributes and abilities are understood in this world and from this, which actions are possible and not possible with which ability.

The Excel file is divided into different spreadsheets, which are interdependent in their functionality. Therefore, some areas are read-only.For this reason, improvements to the [Attributes](#Attributes) and [Abilities](#Abilities) can only be made in the "Character" spreadsheet.

The whole sheet works a lot with references in general, so be careful what you overwrite, but you will quickly understand the logic behind it.

### The character worksheet {#CharacterSheet}

When a character is created, all changes to attributes and abilities are to be made in the Character worksheet.

![The "Character" spreadsheet to illustrate the abilities and attributes](Pictures/Rules/ExcelSheet/CharacterSheet.jpg)

The character spreadsheet is structured so that column A and B list the [Attributes](#Attributes) that each player has and can develop in the world. Each attribute is highlighted with a color (B2:11), these are there to simplified illustrate which attributes are used for the execution of a [skill](#skills). Thus, for example, it is easy to see that a person who wants to play a melee fighter should definitely level up to Strength.

If a race is chosen during [Character Creation](#Character Creation), it can be selected via the dropdown menu in the B1 field. This way, the race's starting attributes are automatically loaded into the attribute fields so that no transfer errors happen.

Also you can find in column A and B in row 13, 15 and 16 the name of the character, as well as its [Health](#Health) and [Stamina](#Stamina). The field "Name" is especially important for the DM, because it is displayed when the app is executed and is used to assign the results to the characters. This must therefore always be adjusted.

Fields E1:26 to I1:26 comprise the [Skills](#Skills) of each character. Column E lists all the skills a player can learn and improve. Columns E and F indicate which attributes are used in which form for the value calculation and column I shows on which level the respective ability is pronounced.

In column K there is the possibility to enter the [knowledge skills as well as the languages](#knowledge skills) a character has mastered. Column L to O is used to enter the [Contacts](#Contacts) of a character. These can serve as a source of information during a campaign or as an ally in hard times.

The table under O11 facilitates scoring for [contacts](#contacts) and [knowledge skills and languages](#knowledge skills) during character creation. This is because a character's knowledge and networking is related to a character's initial attribute score.

### The status {#Status}

The Status spreadsheet is used to provide an overview during a game session. Column A through D rows 1 through 5 show the player which weapons are currently equipped, how much damage these [weapons](#weapons) do, and what [level](#levels) the weapons have. Lines 7 through 12 give space for the character's armor. Here, games can use a menu to select which pieces of armor the character wears. The [Armor total](#Armor) is given in line 13 and is counted against the damage done in combat.

If a player loses [health](#health) or [stamina](#stamina) during a fight due to an action, these changes can be entered in the fields C16 and C17 and thus tracked.

![The spreadsheet "Status" to illustrate applicability](Pictures/Rules/ExcelSheet/Status.jpg)

To keep track of one's potentially available equipment, weapons can be entered in the holster (columns A-D; rows 25-32). The [Spiritual Strength](#Spiritual Strength) can also be documented in K2. The representation of the figure can be customized to give the spreadsheet a personal touch. The fields K28 and K29 are important to enable the [Riding](#Riding). A mount must be entered in this field so that a player can also use this animal.

Column Q must also be kept up to date. Q17 gives the player an overview of the potions consumed. These represent an important role in the context of [Faint](#faint). The [Potion Bag](#Potion Bags) (fields Q21-Q23, for small potion bag) indicates which potions a player can access as part of a side action. If it is empty, a player must use his main actions to get a potion. In case of doubt, the potions in the potion bag save lives.

Field Z2 stands for [Resistances](#Resistances) against means, which a character brings along. In addition, the other fields Z to AB are for the overview for the player, how much [weight](#weight) he carries, to keep an eye on his [stamina costs](#stamina) and which additional resources he has.

It is important to note that all attribute and ability points can only be changed in the [CharacterSheet](#CharachterSheet).

### The inventory

The inventory is the cumulative possession of every adventurer, his belongings and his important items are well listed. A properly kept inventory is the basis for a fast and smoothly running game.

![The "Status" spreadsheet to illustrate applicability](Pictures/Rules/ExcelSheet/Inventory.jpg)

In this spreadsheet, all income and expenses can be entered in the "Purse" section, as well as debts that other players still have to pay off. In addition, items that have been captured can also be "put away" here. The sales value in column J indicates the price for which the items can be sold out of the inventory.

### The change log

To make the process of leveling a bit clearer, there is the "Log" spreadsheet. Here you can find the costs that have to be paid for an improvement. There is also the possibility to document in which sessions there was a level increase, which attribute and ability points were spent for which improvements and how many points are still available, if not all points are directly reallocated and inverted.

![The "Log" spreadsheet to illustrate applicability](Pictures/Rules/ExcelSheet/Log.jpg)

In addition, you can read how many ability points a player is entitled to per levelup, as these are related to the [intelligence value](#intelligence).

### The background story

![The "Backstory" spreadsheet to illustrate applicability](Pictures/Rules/ExcelSheet/Backstory.jpg)

## Attributes {#Attributes}

Attributes play an elementary role as they affect every action a player can perform. To better understand this, it is recommended to look up which skills are associated with which attribute, as the success of every single action in the game is achieved through a player's skills. For example, if a player decides to listen to his Charisma Atrribute, then one will achieve higher scores on the Social Skills.

Besides the attributes that you often have in other games, there are also Luck, Faith, Dice Toxi-Save and Dice Stamina Safe. Dice Toxi-Save and Dice Stamina-Safe indicate how many dice you have available when consuming a potion (Toxicology-Save CrossRef) and when performing an action, which requires Stamina (Stamina-Save CrossRef). Luck and Faith is often used as an auxiliary tool for the DM, where a Save is rolled to determine if a positive or negative consequence will occur in a given situation (Faith/Luck Save CorssRef).

+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| #### Health {#health} | In addition to total health, note that each body part has its own individual health pool (column B, lines 17 to 22). These body parts can be targeted directly with a [aimed shot](#AimedShot). Once a body part's health is reduced to 0, it is no longer functional and a [special effect](#Fainting) occurs depending on the body part. Players can regain health by either consuming a healing potion or using the [Pause and Rest System](#PauseRastSystem). | |

| #### Stamina {#Stamina} | Along with health, stamina is another resource that the player should pay special attention to, as most actions reduce the overall stamina pool. It gets used up if you don't manage the <font color="green">[stamina saves](#stamina save)</font>. Especially during combat, since most actions here use up all of a player's stamina before they even realize it.                                                                                                                                                    | |
| | | |
| | As soon as you have less than 4 points of stamina left all attributes except luck, faith and stamina dice are halved. In short it means that all actions of a player will be significantly weaker and you will take more damage in combat and deal less yourself. If you have no stamina left and another stamina save fails you will fall into unconsciousness. as with health it is also possible to recover stamina by using a stamina potion or the [Pause and Rest System](#PauseRastSystem).                                   | |

: These skills can be mastered by any character.

## The creation {#Character creation}

First of all, it is important to have an idea of what and who you want to play. Although the full picture of a character will only emerge at the end of the creation, it is still important that you know where you want to go and what you enjoy.

Also important is knowing which defensive skill you want to use, <font color="green">[Block or Dodge](#BlockDodge)</font>, as this skill group is one of the most important for adventurers regardless of play style.

### Race and Starting Values {#RaceStarting Values}

The first thing you do is select the race you want to play. The most important thing to note here is that different races have different starting requirements and [Attributes](#Attributes) to work with.

Furthermore, some races have certain abilities - for example, the Goblins' thermal sight - that can bring great advantages.

You start with these base stats:

+----------------------+--------+------------+----------+-------------+----------+--------------+--------------+

</small> </small>

All races start with their language of origin at level 2.

#### Racial Skills {#racialskills .unnumbered}

-   Night Vision: elves can see in the dark.
-   Money Sighted: Dwarves get +3 Instinct on [Intimidate Trials](#Intimidate) when money is involved.
-   Shortsighted: Orcs' shortsightedness makes it impossible for them to use ranged weapons.
-   Thermal Sight: Goblins can see the heat structure of bodies. Normally this is a huge advantage, as they can spot threats both in the dark and through walls. However, some dangerous monsters have no heat signature.
-   Hard Stomach: Halflings have a higher resistance to poisoning from potions due to generations of drug abuse.
-   Mutation: mutation is associated with the <font color="green">[rite of passage of the Animali](#mutation)</font>. In this process, they take on physiological markers of the first monster they hunted. Depending on whether the character is a cub or already mutated the mutation is still pending, or has several individual strengths and weaknesses that match the prey they hunted. In the case of a young animal, the mutation is still played out. If you play a mutated animalus, the mutation is bought via the [Traits System](#Traits) with attribute points, in the case of a cub the mutation is added later.

### Level and skill improvements {#skill improvements}

The following points are available for level increases:

-   Attribute points - used to improve attributes, health and stamina
-   Ability points - used to improve skills

To improve skills and attributes, a certain amount of attribute and skill points must be awarded. Higher values cost proportionally more. Each value can be re-developed, but brings only one ability/attribute point per level. It is important to note, however, that both Luck and Faith cannot be upgraded.

With a levelup you get:

-   three attribute points
-   Ability points depending on the intelligence of the character according to the following scheme:

| intelligence | ability points |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|
| 6 | 12 |
| 7 | 14 |
| 8 | 16 |
| 9 | 18 |
| 10 | 20 |
| 11 | 22 |
| 12 | 24 |
| 13 | 26 |
| 14 | 28 |
| 15 | 30 |
| 16 | 32 |
| 17 | 34 |
| 18 | 36 |
| 19 | 38 |
| 20 | 40 |

During character creation, attributes already have to be paid for with the costs according to the scheme below. Ability points - in contrast - can simply be added at creation and have to be paid only at levelups according to the scheme below.

Both attribute and ability points do not expire when you level up, so you can "save" them for later levels. Furthermore, you can convert one attribute point to two ability points once per level up - this does not work in the other direction.

Attention: when creating a character, attributes may be a maximum of 15, skills a maximum of 45.

#### Cost attribute improvement {.unnumbered}

| Attributes | Cost/Unit |
|:---------:|:--------------:|
| 0-10 | 1 |
| 10-12 | 2 |
| 12-14 | 4 |
| 14-16 | 6 |
| 16-18 | 8 |
| 18-20 | 10 |

#### Cost Health Improvement {.unnumbered}

| health | cost/25 units |
|:----------:|:-------------------:|
| 150-200 | 0,5 |
| 200-300 | 1 |
| 300-400 | 2 |
| 400-500 | 3 |
| 500-600 | 4 |
| 600-700 | 5 |

Note: Health is always increased in units of 25.

#### Cost Ability Enhancement {#Ability Enhancement .unnumbered}

| Abilities | Cost/Unit
|:-----------:|:--------------:|
| 0 -20 | 1 |
| 20-40 | 2 |
| 40-60 | 4 |
| 60-80 | 6 |
| 80-100 | 8 |

The skills and their effects are described [here](#skills).

#### Cost ability group enhancement {#ability groups .unnumbered}

In addition to individual skill enhancement, players also have the option to select a skill group. This has the advantage that all skills in the selected group will be improved together at a cheaper average cost than if they were upgraded individually. The groups have different skills, each matching a job description, according to which different skills are grouped together. In addition, the skill groups also have different costs that are adjusted to the amount and strength of the skills. If one invests in a skill group, this can only be done up to level 40. For example, if a player chooses to upgrade the Knight skill group (where [Armed Melee](#ArmedMelee) is included) to level 30, they can also invest more points in Mercenaries (where Armed Melee is also included) until Armed Melee reaches 40. If you invest more points in mercenaries, armed melee remains at 40, the other skills continue to increase.

An overview of the possible skill groups can be found here:

#### cost endurance enhancement {.unnumbered}

Two points of stamina can be bought at any stamina level for one attribute point.

### Traits {.traits}

#### Positive Traits {.unnumbered}

Positive traits usually bring advantages to the character, but cost attribute points. When you create a character, these traits are cheaper to buy, when you buy them later, they become a little more expensive.

#### Negative peculiarities {.unnumbered}

Negative traits limit the character, but give him attribute points which he can invest in other traits or in attributes.

### Knowledge and languages {#Knowledge skills}

The world of Orbis Astea is characterized by complexity. Here, just as in the real world, individuals do not have the accumulated knowledge of the world. Particularly smart and experienced characters naturally have the broader mental horizon to understand more aspects of their environment.

In order to take into account the abilities in the area of "knowledge of the world" and languages when creating a character, this is calculated by the starting attributes intelligence and instinct.

The number of available points is calculated as follows:

$$\frac{Intelligence \cdot 4 + Instinct}{2}$$ The result is rounded up. You don't have to do this calculation yourself, it is done by the excel sheet.

**Example: Calculation of knowledge and language points**

Standard human: 10 intelligence & 10 instinct

Calculation of Available Points: $(10 \cdot 4 + 10)/2 = 25$

Consequently, the creator of this character has 25 points available.

These can now be awarded for knowledge and/or language levels.

+--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| Language or Knowledge Level | Cost Points: | level of knowledge | level of language |
+:==========================================:+:==============:+:================================:+:==========================================:+
| Level 0 | 0 | No knowledge in the field | No language ability |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| Level 1 | 5 | Basic knowledge | Very simple conversations possible |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| level 2 | 15 | literate & experienced in subject area | communication awkward but complete |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| Level 3 | 25 | Proficient in the subject | Law text and native language level |
+--------------------------------------------+----------------+----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+

These values are absolute - not cumulative costs.\

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Knowledge skills selection options: | Description |
+==================================+==========================================================================================================+
| war tactics | flanking maneuvers, guerrilla warfare, sabotage, formations in combat |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| medicine | recognition and treatment of diseases |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| Seacology | Life on the open sea is only possible if you know the sea |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| cartography | knowing where what is and who might be where |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| | Level 3: Enables forgery of documents |
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| Language selection options:                     |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| Gob (language of the goblins) |
| Orcish |
| Imperial (Empire, Yondalla and Eldria) |

| Dwarvish |
| Elvish |

**Example with a normal character with 50 points:**

-   15 points for Rahkari language level 2
-   5 points for cartography level 1 of the areas of the Rahkari faction
-   5 points for religious knowledge level 1 of the Rahkari faction territories

It is important for DMs to bring in the skills with their own feeling, which could be realistic.

Even after character creation you can improve your knowledge skills. This goes about the [so-called study](#Study).

### Contacts {#Contacts}

Contacts are another piece of the world - the player's social capital, so to speak. They help to get orders, information and other things for which vitamin B is or could be useful. The points that can be awarded for contacts are calculated from the sum: $$(4 \cdot Charisma) + Instinct.$$

These points can then be distributed between the relationship (Influence in [CharacterSheet](#CharacterSheet)) a contact feels towards a character, and the influence (Power in [CharacterSheet](#CharacterSheet)), which is a contact's social standing and power.

The Cost describes how many points a player must spend to enroll a contact. These represent the sum of the respective levels. If you want to have a love relationship with a person from the high nobility, you have to pay a total of 60 points. 30 for level 7 Influence and another 30 points for level 7 Affection.

Both parameters can be assigned on a scale of 1 - 10 each. The following table shows the significance of each scale level in terms of content:

+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+
| Level | Influence | Affection | Costs |
+:=========:+:===================================================:+:======================:+:=========:+
| 1 | Underclass | Acquaintance | 2 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+
| 2 | Normal person | Good acquaintance | 4 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+
| 3 | Socially well-connected person | Colleagues | 7 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+
| 4 | city guard | same circle of friends | 10 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+
| 5 | High Citizen | Friends | 15 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+
| 6 | Lower nobility | Family member | 20 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+
| 7 | Nobility/Military Commander/Lower Nobility/High Official | Close Friends | 25 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+
| 8 | High nobility | Love relationship | 30 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+
| 9 | Highest officials/ministers/army leaders | Best friends | 40 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+
| 10 | Emperor/High Priest/Prince of a Ship of State/etc. | Like own child | 45 |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------------+-----------+

: Contacts and what makes them tick.

### Backpack {#backpack}

All items that are not immediately available are in the backpack, which contains the [inventory](#inventory). An average strong person (strength 10) can carry 40kg in it. In principle, you take the average of strength and physique times 4 to determine the carrying capacity. This is used as the backpack size.

Retrieving an object from the backpack during a fight costs the main action. However, if you are not in combat/under time pressure, you can easily grab objects out of your backpack.

### Holster

Since you want to have weapons quickly at hand in dangerous environments, and don't want to spend ages digging them out of your [backpack](#backpack), holsters were invented. These cost 1250 reiks per holster when you create a character and you can have a maximum of 5 of them. Only certain types of weapons fit into different holsters. More about this [here](#Holster1).

### Equipment

After character creation, the right starting equipment is important. What an adventurer should definitely have is a weapon, a potion bag and possibly armor, since without one the chances of survival will be significantly lower.

Equipment to buy can be found here:

-   You can find [Weapons](#Weapons) here
-   Here you can find [Armor](#Armor)
-   Here you can find [Mounts](#Mounts)
-   Here you can find [Other Items](#OtherItems)
-   Here you can find [Potions](#Potions)

However, when shopping, remember that it can be useful to have some money to spare. After all, living in Orbis Aestea brings <font color="green">[Cost of Living](#Cost of Living)</font>, and it's always useful to have some money left over for quests as well.

### The role of weight {#weight}

Weight plays a HUGE role in Orbis Astea. No character can carry more than their own carrying capacity allows. This is calculated based on strength times four.

#### The Active Weight {#ActiveWeight}

Active Weight is the weight of things carried on the body. It consists of:

-   Weapons in holsters
-   Armor
-   Shield
-   Throwing weapons in holsters

The sum of the weight of these items is the Active Weight. It is divided by 5 and then subtracted from the Physique value to get the <font color="green">[stamina die for stamina save](#stamina save)</font>.

##### The stress levels and their debuffs {#stress level}

+------------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Load | Active Weight | Acrobatics <br>Running \<br\>and Sneaking | Get Up |
+============+:===============:+:==========================================:+:===============:+
| light | weight \< 18 | | movement action |
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------+
| medium | weight \< 30 | -1 die | single action |
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------+
| heavy | weight \> 30 | -2 dice | main Action |
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------+

#### The passive weight

The Passive Weight is the sum of the weight of the items that are in the [Backpack](#Backpack). Together with the Active Weight, it must not exceed the Carrying Load. Beyond that the passive weight has no influence on the game.

##### Additional weight {.unnumbered}

Sometimes the player carries additional weight - for example, an unconscious person. This can come with various disadvantages, which the DM determines. One example is the inability to dodge or run.

## In game

Some values change dynamically in the game. The important ones are listed and explained here.

### Modifiers

Certain effects (potions, music, cold, etc.) give positive or negative modifiers that do not affect thresholds, like external effects (Bad Vision), but change a character's values. They are to be entered with + or - in the "Modifier" column to the right of the respective attribute.

### Faith {#faith}

> "If you anger the gods they judge you, if you pay homage to them they reward you"
>
> --- Old saying

Faith is not in itself a stand-alone attribute, as samples are pretty much always rolled together with luck. The special thing about faith, however, is that you can influence it with various actions. If you behave in harmony with your gods, perform epic deeds or any other action that the DM thinks you deserve, your faith value will increase. If you behave in the opposite way, the value decreases. This value is a way for the DM to reward good roleplay.

This value is supposed to represent the divine favor in crucial situations.

### luck {#luck}

Just as with Faith, Luck can go down and up. For example, if a character pulls off actions that go against his or her own values, the luck value decreases by announcement of the DM. For actions that a character can be particularly proud of, it increases again. The strength of the decrease/increase is determined by the DM.

This value should reflect personal growth and well-being.

### Strength of Mind {#Strength of Mind}

Strength of mind refers to the rate at which the character is still sane. It goes from a maximum value of 100 to a value of zero. Spiritual Strength decreases every time you come into contact with blood gods, serve blood gods, or use a blood god weapon. As long as Spiritual Strength is above 20, there is nothing to worry about. If the Spiritual Strength drops below 20, the DM has the opportunity to make a Luck/Belief save once per session and - if it is not passed - the DM briefly takes control of the character, who will then most likely perform horrendous deeds. If the Spiritual Strength drops below 10, the DM has two chances per session to take over the character. However, if the Spirit Strength drops to zero, the player permanently loses control of the character - and the character falls to the bloody doings of an <font color="green">[evil god](#bloodcult)</font> in the long run.

In interactions, the DM decides by how much the spirit strength drops.

#### Cursed Artifacts

There are a few very strong artifacts (all tier 5) that "make you pay" for their strong effect by making you lose Spiritual Strength every time you use them. These are mostly blood cult relics and can be anything from weapons to amulets with certain effects that a capable DM can think of.

## Longer term injuries

Note, this is rounded down instead of up, contrary to the conventions of Orbis Astera.

### Mutilation {#Mutilation .unnumbered}

A mutilation means that there is only 20% health left of a body part. In this case, it is advisable to seek medical help as soon as possible to avoid crippling. The maimed person can no longer perform checks that involve the maimed body part. In addition, he must pass a Willpower save with Threshold 3, otherwise he falls into <font color="green">[faint](#faint)</font>.

A character can make a bandage that temporarily removes the "crippled" status debuff. The character can also do this himself,if he survived the check to not faint. The value to be achieved is 3.

### Crippled {#Crippled .unnumbered}

Crippling means that the health of a body part has dropped to zero. Thus, the character loses said body part. He is no longer able to perform checks involving that body part and must see a doctor. The long-term consequences of crippling are not to be underestimated, and many adventurers must retire when crippling befalls them.

When crippled, a character must pass a Willpower save or they will fall into <font color="green">[faint](#faint)</font>. The threshold is 5.

## Faint and Death {#Faint}

If you faint you have two options - either wait three hours to wake up on your own, or be given an <font color="green">[epinephrine](#epinephrine)</font>. In either case, a character has the headache of a lifetime and rest is recommended as soon as possible.

There are several methods of fainting, the main ones being:

-   Failed Toxi-Save
-   Narcotics
-   Health drops below zero
-   Stamina reaches zero and you have a failed stamina save
-   Failed Willpower save when maimed or crippled.

In turn, you can only die in two ways:

-   One reaches a health value of -100
-   One loses his health in the unconscious state
