#monsters and other abominations {#monsters}

Monstrosities and monsters are for some city dwellers merely sailor's yarn or even the mental peculiarities of some drunkards.
Nevertheless, monstrosities and monsters - to the chagrin of all who have come into contact with them - belong to the reality in which the All-God has also placed us.

In this respect this treatise should be a list as complete as possible of the monsters which are in the known world.
We cannot confirm everything about some abominations of this world.
The smaller evils such as katakans, female-sized spiders or werewolves are known to many, as some monster hunters have already exhibited skins, heads or even whole animals.

The 21st edition book now includes definitive proof of a usucat, as well as proof of a katakan and a werewolf in the northwest of Nors.

Furthermore, for the first time we were able to show evidence of the breeding mother in Nors sewers by finding a slightly decayed, slightly skinned and decapitated specimen.

In this respect, this book serves as a collector's work, besides collectors, researchers and travelers.

In this respect, I open with the words of the collector and researcher who provided the now largest share of this book, but burned by a lindworm Fisitius Lotharin

> "Monstrosities are the punishment of the All-God. Only who studies you understands the punishment of the All-God behind it. Inosfern study the beast of this world, so that you can be closer to the All-God by it!"

## Introduction

Monsters are part of the everyday life of the Animali, as their entire culture is geared towards hunting, killing and honoring monsters.

These pagans do not live in harmony with the All-God, and thus cannot ascend to heaven, but these skilled hunters have, according to rumors, created books about monsters and probably have a much older, more extensive and possibly more correct knowledge about the abominations of this world.

To ensure that the sons and daughters of the All-God do not fall to his punishments, besides prayers, knowledge about these monsters helps to be prepared when you go to their territories.

It should be explicitly noted that monsters can also inflict heavy losses on the military under certain circumstances.
For example, about 430 soldiers were killed by Znitins (huge, surprisingly intelligent hunting spiders, native to the great elven forest) while marching through the forest or could not be found.

This knowledge is also indispensable for lumberjacks, as they often enter areas that offer retreats for these monsters.

It should be explicitly mentioned that the Sky Mountains and the Grey Wasteland are very poorly explored.
The knowledge about the abominations living there is primarily based on statements of single surviving dwarves as well as on orc tribes that regularly hunt in the mountains for religious reasons.

It is difficult to roughly classify monsters.
The punishments of the Allgod are too diverse in their abilities, strengths and weaknesses.

The world of monsters and abominations can nevertheless be divided into rough categories, although these are not always sharp.

Roughly comprehensive there are:

-   Hellspawn / Allgott verlassene - mostly roughly human shape, are characterized by the fact that they attack only human-like beings and show no aggression towards their own kind.

-   Worms - as the name says, long, round, bad temperament, often blind.

-   Piscari - the monsters in the rivers, lakes and seas which look like fish

-   Abyss dwellers - what the depths of the seas give birth to abominations.
    Extremely little is known about this group.

-   Lizard-like - dragon lindworms, armored lizards.
    Characterized by the fact that they explicitly hunt other monsters.
    They are usually of higher intelligence and almost all have fireproof skin covered with bone scales.

-   Foeduculus - the group translated as Ugly Humans includes humanoids mostly of larger stature than human.
    Are always bipedal, usually neutral towards humans if you respect their boundaries.
    Use weapons, throw boulders, and may travel in social groups.

-   Beasts - werewolves, leadbacks and others which can be seen as parts of the given natural order.
    The carnivorous variants hunt everything, the vegetarian species usually pose an agricultural problem.

-   Many-legged - monsters which have more than 4 legs are, surprisingly, among the many-legged.
    These include the different varieties of scorpions, spiders and giant insects.
    They are generally characterized by the fact that they are dangerous to armed people and usually wear hard outer armor as skin which makes them mostly invulnerable to simple swords and bows.

-   Bone skulls - despite their relative rarity, bone skulls count as a monster category of their own.
    Their body shape, number and shape of extremities, size, resistance are highly variable.
    the only uniformity is that the head is a bone-like plate - similar to the shape of a skull.
    There are neither mouths nor visible eyes.
    Around the mouths, which are located in other positions, there are usually several tentacles.
    Bone skulls probably possess an intelligence which coordinates in the background.

-   Slimes - Bound to wetlands, such as swamps, floodplains, and the permanently moist forests of Silva Nacia, this group is characterized by a frequently slimy bladder, sometimes filled with acid.
    Body shape is usually highly variable.

-   Misty Groveii - The strange monsters of the Misty Grove are grouped together in the Misty Groveii category.
    In principle, these abominations are found only in the inner reaches of the Misty Grove and are the least known group along with the Bone Skulls and the Abyssal Dwellers of the Seas.
    Like the bone skullers, it can be assumed that the mist groveii are controlled by a collective intelligence or possess a collective consciousness.
    The determination and categorization is complicated by the fact that the reports from the Misty Grove are often distorted by the Maladria, the cause of ide mental confusion in the Misty Grove.

-   Vampiridae - apart from the hatred of celandine, all vampirdae are united by the drinking of blood.
    Blood is drunk from a variety of warm-blooded higher animals.
    Furthermore, all vampiridae have claws, talons and teeth capable of absorbing blood, through muscles that can use the inside hollow claws as pumps.
    This allows Vampiridae to regenerate quickly even in battle.
    Among the best known vampiridae are katakans, which represent the middle spectrum of vampiridae in dangerousness.

Special mention should be made of legends.
These monsters are documented only from ancient lore of orcs, dwarves or elves.
Since the first edition of this work more than thirteen decades ago, no evidence of these legends has been found.

-  Anomalies - Anomalies are monsters that cannot be assigned to any of the other categories. They are all unique and behave differently than other monster categories, in which the monsters all behave in a similar manner.

## Hellspawn

### Bermata Devil

There is widespread uncertainty among scholars about these monsters of perdition, called Bermata Devils.

Thus, the ancient writing "Of Ugliness and Monsters" by Sir Charles of Alt-Haag reports about incidents of invasions by the early Elder princes directed towards the Bermata Valley, about several attacks of "armored foeducules" which, swinging axes and with high mobility, cut their way through scouting troops and flanks of Elder armies.

They were described as *"[...] armored, overman-sized human-like figures without eyes and teeth as long as fingers and powers that make even orcs look like limp-wristed weaklings. "*

Several decades later in another, less substantial, attempt by the eldritch lords, on the other hand, the monsters were "*[...] described as lizards with hair and sneering laughter, the agility of a hare with the strength of an ox." described*."\
This group also managed to sketch a burnt bermata devil and thus learn a little more about the body of this hellspawn. However, this sketch was lost, only the artistic interpretation of Mangold von Straffeld was preserved.

Away from these reports remained only that of a wanderer south of Austen who described such a creature with "*haemish laugh and high agility, larger than any known man "*.

### Large impaler

The Great Impaler represents a special abomination.
Its name, can be traced with the illustration below.

!["Great Impaler in the Battle of Bonefield Gorge"](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/GreatImpaler.jpg)

Impaler belong to the monsters of the Hellspawn class and are four meters in height from the ground.
Equipped with seven arms and 3 legs, the unnaturalness of this abomination is immediately apparent.
The 7 arms all end in long spikes and sturdy spines and have razor sharp edges.
The 7 arms can be moved independently of each other making it virtually impossible for even experienced soldiers with shields to block them.
Skewers are extremely aggressive and rarely look ahead, making it easy to lure them into ambushes.
However, the occupied attacks of the impalers are mainly limited to evening and night hours, which can make the coordination of an ambush difficult.
Also, due to the lack of intelligence, no territoriality and mobility, it is difficult to deploy organized military groups in time to fight these monsters.

Fighting Great Impalers is done with spears or halberds in formation under heavy armor.
It is almost impossible to fix the arms of the impaler as they are usually equipped with much more strength in the individual arms than an orc with hands could muster.
On the other hand, it is helpful to use throwing spears to restrict the movement patterns so that the infantry can block the attacks of the spearman.

Fire and explosives should never be used, as they can cause the impaler to flee, which will cause him to go on the rampage again.

There is evidence of random dispersal of impalers throughout the known world.
Reports from the Rah Kari, Eldria, orc tribes, and dwarven cities suggest exactly this.
The methods of control are similar among all cultures.

The reproduction runs over the splitting off of own body halves and grown specimens are visible at the 2nd mouth at the flank of the monster.
It is therefore immensely important to explicitly kill the small part again when eliminating the large spear.
This one does not pose a threat immediately, but it feeds on the mother animal's corpse and then buries itself in the soil, where after a short time a new maturing spike comes out and then, probably after a few months, the problem with a large spike exists again.

The largest known specimen of an impaler was sighted after a skirmish between the Imperial Army and the rebels of Eldria, which took on a greenish color due to the consumption of Awakened and probably reached about 7 meters in height.
It could not be killed, only driven away by setting it on fire.

Children's stories about it still exist in Eldria.

### Kaisot

Kaisots are monsters that are about 10 meters high and equipped with huge, human-like arms. They are assigned to the hellspawn.
Their appearance does not resemble anything that could arise naturally.
They have three heads, 6 arms and 2 - 4 legs which gives them a certain spider-like appearance.
Their movement speed can easily catch up with even the fastest horses when the three heads coordinate, making it impossible to flee from these abominations in the classical sense.
Kaisote have no known armor and are surrounded by flesh all over their bodies, making it possible to fight Kaisots with a wide variety of tactics, more on that later.
The three heads of the Kaistos can communicate with each other via an undeciphered language and thus can also talk to other Kaisots.
As a result, it occasionally happens that several Kaistos launch a coordinated attack against villages, if 2 reports from dwarves and 4 from orcs are to be believed.

The distribution of Kaisots is mostly confined to mountainous areas, with a particular concentration where there are many cave systems, which they visit at random times to sleep or rest.
It is unknown what Kaisots eat in particular, and dwarven scholars and orc tribal leaders claim that they eat anything indiscriminately.
This includes stones, cows, orcs, humans, dwarves, trees, or even pallisade walls reinforced with iron.
As a result, the opinion that these hellspawn monsters are only there to destroy humanoid civilizations has spread in the areas occupied by Emperors.

![Depiction of the Man-Eater of Dulukhai](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Kaisot.jpg)

According to reports, several dozen orc settlements west of Bonefield Gorge have been destroyed by Kaisots in recent centuries, making some orc tribes deeply reluctant to settle there, even though the deeper valleys and rivers would provide a considerable food source.

Kaisots, however, can be successfully fought with several tactics.
Kaisots, who are presumably all but blind, are sensitive to fire due to a lack of protective skin layers, so a combination of moltovika and large amounts of oil quickly proves helpful.
Another tactic, which is cheaper but more daring, is to douse carcasses of cows or farm animals with oil and set them on fire, and with extremely agile and light-footed fighters, make noise near the burning carcasses, usually causing them to quickly reach there with their arms and get badly burned.
This tactic usually allows one of the three heads to keep from crushing people for the duration of the fight.

The general tactic, if you don't have big guns, is to confuse the 3 heads of the Kaisot with at least 4 small shock troops, which makes it impossible for them to act in a coordinated way, which strongly limits their agility.
In the heat of battle, the 3 heads usually cannot coordinate sufficiently, which makes it easier to overwhelm them.

A special tactic is to let extremely good slingshots aim at the heads of the Kaistos with Moltovika, thus simply blowing away their skulls.
Two Moltovika are usually enough to make the last head move only by dragging or not at all, so that it can be killed slowly by ranged archers without hesitation.
Here it is recommended to shoot through the nostril on the head or the usually open mouth to eliminate the brain of the abominations.

Kaisots are a particularly sought-after good for noble war veterans, where hunting for kaistos is often proclaimed after wars.
The kaisote is an ingredient needed for a potion to regrow limbs.
The "Potion of Kaistot" is an extremely sought after commodity and a handful of alchemists explicitly advertise the ability to make kaisote potions during and shortly after wartime, provided the heart is delivered via relay horse courier.

### Usukats

Usukats are probably the worst plague of abominations to plague Eldria for the last 300 years.
The origin of the Usukats is unknown, but it is surprising that these abominations with which the All-God tests our faith have apparently not been around for so long.

Usukats are characterized by a humanoid shape, which is white-haired on the head and back.
They have no discernible eyes and are completely odorless when the earth is removed from their bodies.
This may seem insignificant, but leads to the fact that Animali tribes do not really hunt Usukats, and thus it is up to Eldria's guards to send these abominations back to the burning damnation from which they were apparently expelled.

Usukats, unsurprisingly, have no sight and probably orienteer by smell, hearing and touch.
They are nocturnal and seem to disappear completely from the face of the earth during the day.
Usukats are faster than humans, which causes them to give survivors nightmares, especially at night - medically known as "reverberations of the Usukat".
Survivors lose sleep and after a few weeks either lose their minds or the nightmares subside over time, allowing a return to normal life.
Weaknesses of the Usukats are not known, but survivors of the Austen Massacre report that screaming children can scare Usukats away - which according to Humboldt of Ghent, a scholar of the world's abominations, is bullshit and is only meant to motivate children to communicate the attack of an Usukat to others before "the poor young soul is torn from the child and its insides are eaten".

The intelligence of the Usukat can probably be compared to that of more cunning werewolves, but Usukats have no territorial claims.
This unfavorable fact led 156 n.
R.
where one night several Usukats appeared in front of and inside Austen.

Almost the entire city guard was killed or seriously wounded and at least 17 Usukats were killed.

![Depiction of an Usukat hunt in Eldira](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Usukats.jpg)

> "It was a night like any other. We had harvested the crops 2 weeks ago, they were good this year. A mild autumn evening, moonless and you could hear the rustling of the leaves if you did your need a bit away from the well frequented taverns. The children were in bed and priests were comforting those who had lost their loved ones to the plague of flesh maggots. The city guard was patrolling and the Count of Austen was doing what was required, fighting corruption among the city guard and expelling and hanging those who could not renounce narcotics and adrenaline. On the next Saturday, the ecclesia was to call for prayers and honor the count for his deeds for the children of the All-God.

> The young man with his soaked trousers led the guards, the giant, and the hunters to the place, while I was told to contact the captain of the city guard - which I did.

> The first guard was thrown through an open door in the alley with a blow of the back of his arm and the second one hacked at the Demon's arm, whereupon the Demon got his arm torn out screaming.

> A sword blow from behind into the lower back, the head was simply out of reach, made the Demon buckle again.
> The demon turned around and, with the guard's headless corpse, beat the other guard soldier to a pulp while the soldier emerged from the house and rushed at the beast, visibly dazed.

> Suddenly I heard the screaming of the people in the background again, and down the alley I saw the scurrying of a tall white figure and guards running away from it or after it.
> I tried to open the door of the house behind me, which I succeeded in doing, but the door squeaked considerably, whereupon I noticed how the demon turned in my direction.
> I stopped, stiff with fright.
> It felt like time was standing still when the soldier who broke through the house suddenly showed a sign of life again - after which it went into the house.
> As the Demon squeezed through the narrow door, dragging the doorframe along with it, I saw the giant again as he readied his two-handed sword for a thrust and slowly approached the monster.
> He managed it and rammed the two-handed sword into the beast from below, where the soft parts are in humans, whereupon the beast, startled, cried out and kicked the giant against the alley wall, whereupon he sank to the ground without moving.
> In the meantime, the captain picked himself up, amidst the dismembered corpses of children, women and his men, and hacked at the beast lying on the ground until it stopped moving.
> I couldn't believe my eyes, so I stayed in the house, looking at the slaughter of the devil while the commander tried to help the giant.
>
> I looked down the alley and saw a mother walking up the alley with her baby in her arms.
> Suddenly another demon was seen and heard running after her.
> All God please forgive me, but I couldn't open the door, I just couldn't.
> I couldn't save the baby and the mother.
> She ran and screamed for help and the baby screamed and when she saw the carnage of the alley, saw the commander, she screamed in a shrill voice "Kill it. Kill it! Go on kill it already!" The commander close his sword and ran towards the mother and the child.
> Suddenly I saw the demon, bloodied tore down the mother in the run.
> You could hear the cracking of bones again and, whatever the All-God wants to tell us with this ordeal, it's not love when you hear a mother crushing her own child and you hear the muffled cries of a baby.
>
> I don't know what happened then, I couldn't see it anymore, I didn't see anything, everything went black.
> > I heard outside the clatter of the commander's armor and the bending of metal and the piercing of flesh, but no scream of the monster.
> Then again shattering conches, like tinder in the crimson.
> Tinder for the fires of hell that rose in Austen that night.

### Brood mother

Brood mothers are a true punishment to the eyes.
Imagine a bald pale man overeaten beyond recognition.
This one has about a dozen breasts.
Rumor has it that brood mothers have several tentacles and unusable hands.
locomotion follows terribly slow from about 2 meters with one movement.
So any person can just get out of the way of this monster.

The main tentacles are thick, from which it can be concluded that broodmothers should not be encountered in close combat.
Up to 6 other tentacles are located, protruding from the ground near the brood mother and either procure food or defend it.

Brood mothers give birth to ghouls and can become a real nuisance after some time.

Little is known about their weaknesses to poisons or fire.
It is recommended to kill a broodmother with the help of scorpions and a good handful of heavily equipped soldiers.
Just aim at the broodmother's head.
Any children rushing to the defense, i.e. the ghouls, are no problem with swords and shields.

Alchemically, no use is known about Brood Mother Ingridientien.

## Worms

### Stone worm

> "Break sticks and stones when you fall into a stone worm hole.
>
> Don't rejoice, for soon you'll have stone worm acid on your face."
>
> --- Poem about the stone worm

Stone worms belong to the larger end of the worm-like monsters.
Stone worms grow up to 14 meters long and live obligatory underground.
They do not eat animals, but feed on special rock, which is a green fluorescent mass that partly illuminates the passages of the stone worms.
Stone worms are rarely encountered and their tunnels are usually older than the founding of the empire.

They have no eyes and dig through the soil and rock amazingly fast with their incredibly hard front teeth and the help of ejected acid.

Stone worms are responsible for a good part of the caves in the Himmelspitzen Mountains and in the mountains around the Berma Valley.
It is not recommended to follow the corridors of these worms, because from a certain depth you may encounter sleeping specimens, which react irritably to curious explorers.
In most cases, their sleeping chambers are characterized by about 12 meters, almost vertical tunnels.
This serves, according to doctrine, that lindworms can not find access here and thus can not become their prey.

Stone worms generally have soft body surfaces, which makes it easier for them to navigate through natural caves or narrow crevices.

About the reproduction is only known that they are only 3 eggs large clutches usually guarded by 2 mothers.

Their intelligence is difficult to judge due to lack of knowledge.

### Aworm

Swallowworms are endemic to the volcanically active areas of Wurmfall - which got its name from the Swallowworms.
Swallowworms are the largest monstrosities in the entire known world.
Body lengths of 40-50m have been reported.
exact measurements do not exist, of course.
Bone-like remains, however, indicate specimens that are sometimes much longer.
Blackworms get their name from their dark and exceedingly thick skin, which allows them to crawl even through molten rock, lava.
Although worm activity is primarily limited to periods of volcanic inactivity, several independent reports of low worm activity during the volcanic phase have observed worm activity at the surface.
This is also where the 7 observations of attacks by dragons on Asworms originated.
It should be noted that the dragons were successful in only one case because it was an apparently already injured animal, which, due to a nearby volcanic explosion - untypical for the shield volcanoes of the region - hurled a huge rock chunk of 15 meters onto the "head" of the worm.

However, as mentioned, ash worms are primarily active during volcanic dormancy.
During this time, they eat through and walk the cooled lava passages and surfaces.
The food of the worms consists, as with the stone worms, primarily of special fluorescent rocks which they process in an unknown way.
The heavy rainfall of worm fall, probably caused by volcanic gases, which occurs about every 12 years, causes the worm activity to increase.
Here the worms can often be observed sucking up huge amounts of water.
They also usually consume the vegetation that blooms and sprouts after the rains.
During this time, walking through the desert is an undertaking that should only be undertaken by all-gods forsaken.

Swallowworms presumably reproduce by laying eggs, but so far no eggs have been found, let alone young.
Swallow worms have "teeth" on their heads, somewhat similar to stone worms, with which they presumably break up and eat soil.
Swallow worms should not be provoked, if at all possible.
Provocations of swallowworms are primarily triggered by masses of creatures tramping around.
Thus, stray herds of Bermuda buffalo - which wander into the Vulacnian Desert when it is greening - are usually crushed by the worms, slain or eaten.

Accordingly, abgraten with armies larger than 20 men during the volcanic dormant phase, that is, the activity phase of the worms to wander through.

It is assumed that humans do not possess any weapons that could harm the worms, since not even dragons can harm them.
Therefore, it is not surprising that we have no evidence of natural predators of swarmworms.

### World Worm {#WorldWorm}

Worldworms are more legend than regularly observed monsters.
They are particularly huge swarm worms that dig much deeper and can march entire cohorts side by side through their tunnels.
Fortunately, they almost never come to the surface.

## Piscari

### Northern Sea Crocodiles

Crocodiles have been known to many since the books of Azai the Wise from Atumpet, especially since some specimens live in the Misty Grove as well as in some swamps of Eldria.
A long dagger-like teeth spiked mouth, bone plates on the back, slit eyes as if it were the soul of a demon that lives in the long drawn head.
In addition, four legs and a long powerful tail.
The hard skin with bone plates makes it difficult for unarmed people to fight against such a beast of nature.

Now northern sea crocodiles are also wonderfully rendered in this description, but the fish-rich waters and reefs make these specimens grow incredibly large, and old.
For example, several fishermen have been able to confirm over generations that one and the same North Sea crocodile, recognizable by the spearhead stuck in its skull, is at least 170 years old.
Since, as with other crocodiles, the North Sea varieties never stop growing, this individual is estimated to be at least 17 meters, which is why only large fishing boats now attempt to fish around its reef.

Although the seas are generally empty, one should refrain from traveling in small boats in the cold waters of the seas north of the Sky Peak Mountains for longer than necessary, after all there are more pleasant things than being devoured by a hungry centenarian.

### Dark Esteus

Monsters of the seas are far less explored, and so anyone can assume that the depths of the seas are inhabited by more abominations than citizens of Eldria loyal to the Empire.

Dnkleosteus is one of these monsters, named after the fisherman and explorer Nixan Dunkleosteus, these monsters are several meters long and equipped at the head with a bone armor just under the skin which makes it virtually impossible to quickly hunt down these monsters or even fight against them.
If one is not busy with drowning in the water alone, Dunkleosteus tear in the salty waters and the brackish waters more often swimming cows and larger fish and also careless fishermen.
Dark eosteus can be deterred by bright light or noise from e.g. exploding moltovikas, but the latter is not recommended as the risk of injury is high.

Dark eosteus can be killed by cannons when they swim on the surface, but you usually have exactly one shot before they are scared off by the noise.

According to old traditions of the first seafarers, this was a crucial reason why seafarers shouted their songs loudly to prevent small wooden boats from being attacked.

Unfortunately, nothing is known about the reproduction of these bony fish, but small Dunkleosteus can be observed in brackish water, where they are often caught by fishermen.
Their meat is said to have a strong aphrodisiac effect.

![A Dunkleosteus off the coast of Stormcap - Illustration by Nixan Dunkleosteus](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Dunkleosteus.jpg)

## Abyss dwellers

### Boat Eater

The Boat Eater is the nickname for a monster that has attacked and destroyed Imperial Navy ships of up to 35 meters several times.
It is a type of sea serpent that has several bone-gray skull plates on its face from which countless tentacles spring.
On the underside of the head is a jaw with bone plates that crushes things.
The tentacles of the head tear ships and other sea monsters into sufficiently small bites, where they are then crushed in the mouth.

The size of the boat-eater is difficult to estimate, as the entire body never protrudes from the water.

Its red glowing skin on the tentacles indicates if the boat eater is hungry or seems to be having a bad day.
The rest of this Scheusal's body is surrounded by silvery, smooth skin and has a uniformly round shape, making it move through the sea like a snake.
As is the case with seafaring creatures, there are also various myths surrounding this creature.
It is said to attack either only at full moon at night or at full moon under the midday sun.

Other seafarers swear that rubbing the sails and hull with a special algae helps prevent this creature from destroying the thousands of hours of woodwork that go into ships within minutes.

Although there are now dozens of reports of this creature, due to the small number of survivors, few rah-kari and imperial sources can provide reasonable information, making only the name "boat-eater" true in all cases.

### Lagoon Maiden

> If some bastards once again take a young woman away to rape her and then stab her and leave the carcass in the lagoon, the lagoon maiden will come at some point during the night and put the carcass over herself.
> So what could be more disgusting?
> An insect-like creature that covers itself with the half-decayed skin of a human carcass"
>
> Julius Blackheart to Breitbart

Lagoon minnows are generally considered to be water or lagoon dwelling insect-like animals that fertilize themselves with the remains of animals, fish, algae or human cadavers and eat the innards down to the skin.
It is believed that this creature probably protects itself from the sun's rays, since "naked" lagoon damselflies are never seen during the day.

The Lagoon Maidens grow up to two and a half meters in length, but usually much shorter, as in the water sharks seem to have a hearty appetite for the poorly swimming many-legged creatures.
The many-legged creatures wrapped in rotting stuff exude such a strong pungent disgusting smell that you are usually forewarned for a long time before these creatures come too close.
In addition, you can hear the slurping of the animals on the beach, because the carcasses usually sit extremely loose with time, and so sometimes shreds of skin or crustacean mats fall off.

In the water, lagoon damselflies are usually significantly faster than humans and can thus pose a threat to inexperienced ones, but they are easily defeated with well-aimed spear thrusts.
In the water, the many-legged minnows feed on carrion and crabs and eventually catch their prey thanks to their leeching venom.
Here the tongue is thrown like a rope at or around the future feast.
In the water, one usually notices the stinging pain, after which one should definitely get out of the water, as drowning can occur due to muscle cramps.
The cramps subside after a few hours, unless you have narcotics available.

However, if one is immobile in the water and on land due to the cramps, the lagoon dragonflies notice these movements and begin to eat the victim alive.
On this occasion with a mouth opening lying on the stomach side with grinding jaws of crabs the carapace or of humans the skin is rubbed or broken.
This is an extremely tedious and unpleasant process - which, however, led to the fact that this is used by some Rah-Kari as a method of torture.

This process, even if the victim is rescued, often leads to death due to the transmission of disease unless medical care is provided.

Lagoon damselflies are found primarily on and in islands in the Southern Ocean and are not found in the open ocean.
The main time of activity is at night and in the evening.
However, nothing is known about the reproduction of these animals.

Control of lagoon damselflies should be done with crossbows or bows.
The new black powder weapons can be used for this purpose, but this is unnecessarily expensive.
Daredevils can also use long lances or spears against these animals.

Caution is advised at full moon, because here the animals sometimes crawl out of the water in droves, which can quickly appear threatening, unless you are proficient in combat.

A detail on the side, are the collections of lagoon damselflies for warlike purposes or to extort islands or sea forts, as these animals quickly become as persistent as barnacles and are virtually impossible to eradicate.

### Sea scroll plague

Sea roll plagues are actually several organisms.
First, there are the sea roll pest nests, which harbor other aquatic plants and worms in addition to the pesky plagues of sea roll pest worms.
Why these nests contain such a smorgasbord of organisms is not known.

Sea roll nests are common in shallower seas and the Setra delta foothills in the Southern Ocean and are usually fished around, or if in shallow waters, fought with long lances from the safety of the boat.
The nests are extremely resistant and consist of bone-like plates which are seemingly randomly distributed over the entire tissue.

These nests, if harassed, release sea roundworms which are then extremely aggressive in the water attacking anything in the vicinity.
It is not known what the nests eat or if they are even organisms in their own right, or rather the sum total of critters inside.

![A Nest of the Sea Scroll Plague - Illustration by Traxinus Juvian [^MandelwerkTheFractalWaspTroll]](Pictures/Flavor/Monsters/the_fractal_wasp_troll_by_mandelwerk.png)

The nests additionally release hallizunogens into the water, which act on humans and orcs like simple madnika.
On elves, however, these drugs have no effects.
The representation of the nests is generally not very purposeful, because the nests have very different morphologies from nest to nest.
The only uniformity is the mixture of reds/browns and bones, beige hues.
Traxinus Juvian, a wandering artist who was hanged by imperial officials for selling Madnika, was inspired by the drugs in the water here and drew the famous painting "A Nest of Sea Scroll Plague", supposedly with the blood of the insides of the nests.

![Sea Scroll Plague Worm - Depiction of Traxinus Juvian](Pictures/Flavor/Monsters/Sea Scroll Plague Worm_Andreas_Fellner.jpg)

The nests pose no threat to boats passing through during the day.
However, fishermen at the Setradelta should avoid fishing in the twilight hours, because here the sea roll pestworms are on "hunt" and so also boats crawl up and fishermen and some sailors already prepared the way into the realms of the deceased.

The worms can be easily scarfed or chopped from boat when they climb up the hull.
It is important to clear the worms from boat hulls when fishing near a nest.

Rumor has it that the bites, which are rarely fatal, cause an allergy which prevents the consumption of wheat and rice for life.
Furthermore, the worms should not be set on fire, as they are very flammable and have occasionally led to the burning of sails or small cutters.

## Lizard-like

### Lindworm

Misleadingly, lindworms are not related to worms but are probably descendants of dragons.
Lindworms, sometimes known as armored lizards or cave dragons, can in many cases breathe fire.
Most recent specimens killed by orcs, however, no longer breathe fire.

Their skin consists of thick bone plates on the upper side and lateral body regions.
Lindworms can reach body lengths of up to 8 meters, according to old lore up to 15 meters are possible, but this could not be confirmed for 136 years.

Lime worms, in contrast to the true dragons, are less intelligent and tend to react more on instinct.
This may be historically due to their often subterranean lifestyle, where there is little point in acting rationally.
Lindworms are able to see in the dark, as are many cave dwellers.
Bright daylight, on the other hand, blinds them, if reports from orcs are to be believed.

Little is known about the reproduction of lindworms.
Young animals could not be found until now, which is due to the unexplored stone worm tunnels, which sometimes lead several meters vertically into the depth.
In the 136 years since the first appearance of this wonderful work only 7 cases could be proved where lindworms cooperated with conspecifics.

> The punishment of the greedy dwarfs should be the Lindworm! He shall melt those who fall to greed and do not dwell in the face of the sun."
>
> --- Excerpt from the work of Father Sistan Erindan - The life of the dwarves - a non-heretical treatise

![Illustration of a living lindworm](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Lindwurm.jpg)

Orcs, who have most of the lindworm knowledge, if they are fire breathing lindworms, usually use lindworm skin for protection and fast and targeted attacks on the underside of the lindworm.
Preferably, Orcs use two-handed war hammers and long bone spears made from the bones of Lindworms.
First, provoke the Lindworm to breathe fire and hide behind the Lindworm's skin.
Once the lindworm has used up its fire reserves, which allow for about 30 seconds of spitting fire, you give the lindworm spear thrusts.
These serve to provoke the lindworm further.
Afterwards, several orcs can jump on the Lindwurm with war hammers and use hammer blows to work on its skull.
This does not kill the Lindwurm, but it does disorient the Lindwurm, after which spears can actually be used to attack the underside of the head and neck.

Special mention should be made of the observed act of an orc tribal leader named Gra-Ash-Tark.
He was able to smash a lindworm skull with a single blow of his 60 kilo (!) warhammer - which killed the lindworm immediately.

### Dragon

Dragons have always been known from legends of the common people.
There is little to tell about dragons, as most have all but disappeared over the last few centuries, which some scholars associate with the dragons' territoriality.

Dragons are intelligent armored lizards that fly with a wingspan of 25 meters in some cases.
The coloration of dragons is generally extremely variable.
Living specimens have been observed in colors ranging from obsidian black to near white variants, as can be seen in the illustration below.
They are extremely territorial and mating has not been observed, however a total of 14 dragon eggs have been found or sampled to date.
The hatching of these was unsuccessful in every case.

Dragon hatchlings are, according to our sparse knowledge, usually protected by their mother for years - sometimes in extra nests made of molten rock.

Dragons feed on almost everything that is naive enough to oppose them.
These include lime worms, stone worms, as well as a fight between a swarm worm and a dragon was known which ended in a draw, because the swarm worm retreated back under the surface.

! [Free interpretation of the so-called "dragon lord". The largest dragon ever seen with a wingspan estimated at 30 meters](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/drachenfuerst.jpg)

### True Dragon {#TrueDragon}

True dragons are indistinguishable from normal dragons to the naked eye, though a true dragon is immensely more dangerous because it is capable of breathing fire.
Fortunately, true dragons are even rarer than conventional ones, so there are only 4 confirmed true dragons left in all of Orbis Astea, with the most famous residing in <font color="green">[Wandia](#Wandia)</font>, one in the Sky Peak Mountains, and it's not known for sure about the others.

The fire of a true dragon is its most dangerous weapon.
Thus, a single dragon could breathe fire continuously for an estimated 60 seconds before it departed.
The dragon's flames are capable of melting iron under certain circumstances.
Therefore, in case of an encounter with a true dragon, it is not advisable to carry more than absolutely necessary, and it is best to take the legs in the hand and look for the wide instead of fighting.

## Foeduculus {#Foeduculus}

### Terrut

The largest known representative of the Foeduculus are the Terrut.
At around 7 meters tall, these abominations in humanoid form make even Gravis seem small in stature.
Terrutes are solitary creatures and will eat anything humans find palatable, making conflict inevitable.

The terrutes are unexpectedly not easy monsters to defeat.
Apparently not marked with special intelligence, but all the more powerful in all other respects, Terrute should not be fought without a small army.
Terrute run around partly armed with simple weapons, partly handling tree trunks.
The hunt for the Eater of Icefall in Nors, described in the above story, turned out to be an absolute disaster.
A nobleman from Nors at that time gathered around 50 men to make the pasture on the northern slopes of the Himmelspitzen mountains safe, because the past years harvest was worse than usual.
Mercenaries armed to the teeth with crossbows, bows and spears and large tower shields were simply killed by the Terrut.
The first day he was walking around with a cow in his arms and was barely hurt by the bows and crossbows.
In the evening the men lost him.
The next day he came running along with a log and a shield, at least 5 meters long, 3 meters wide.
The crossbowmen fired 2 volleys , then the Terrut was there, hammering 2 soldiers into the ground like nails.
he hurled 4 more down the slope with the log.
The remaining men and the nobleman on his horse fled in all directions.
The poorest souls he followed, ramming them into the ground or knocking them down the hill.

Consequently, little is known about the life of a Terrut.
It is not clear how old they become, or how big the biggest ones are, how they reproduce and what drives them.

In fact, all the scholars interviewed agree that terrutes should simply be avoided and grazing livestock should be kept free so that terrutes do not devour the entire herd.
No terrut attacks are known to occur at night, which at least should not deprive people of sleep.
Terrut attacks are relatively rare, but are more common in the mountainous areas and foothills than in the more developed areas.

### Gravis

A Gravis is a creature not really classifiable as a monster, but since no better classification can be found for them they are in this book.

A Gravis is a monstrous creature that is intelligent enough to live in a social structure and understand simple comments and instructions from humans.
This goes so far that sometimes real conversations can be held with Gravi.
However, conversation is only halfway accurate, as the vocal cords of a Gravis can only produce unintelligible roars, and conversations are therefore rather one-sided.
Nevertheless, Gravis understand people to some extent, which can be seen in their reactions.

A Gravis is characterized by two things: Horrendous strength and an almost supernatural ability to react.
Their already thick and leathery skin recovers in no time even from deep cuts and wounds, which makes them incredibly dangerous enemies that can smash entire battalions of simple soldiers equipped with oversized clubs.

![Depiction of a Gravis in the service of a free company](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/gravis.jpg)

A Gravis, as noted, has a very thick, almost armor-like skin.
Because of their "communication skills" and obvious advantages in the field, they are popular with mercenary companies, who use the as frontline breakers.
Having a Gravis in the company is a rare, but more than crucial, tactical advantage.
Therefore, many companies equip a Gravis with additional equipment to tickle even more benefits out of him.
It should be mentioned here that the Imperial Army does not allow Gravis in their ranks, as they are "unholy creatures" according to the Ecclesia.

But why would a Gravis serve in a human army?
According to the research of Primus Lauthaus, a large amount of sparkling objects is a mating bid of the Gravi.
A potential mate will only accept the offer of another Gravis if he has enough sparkling objects to be a good potential mate - and human coins or treasures are great sparkling objects.
Therefore, Leithaus assumed that for many Gravis, employment paid off more than other methods of getting "sparkle stuff."
It is also interesting that the sparkle stuff loses all meaning after the mating bid for Gravi and can therefore simply be taken away.
Lauthaus' theory is based on the investigation of stolen objects during Gravis raids from villages close to their habitats, as well as from observations of Gravi from a distance.
However, this theory is rather controversial and it is opposed by the theory of the Ekklesia, which says that Gravi are a sign of the All-God that man can make even great monsters his subjects (because of these theoretical differences, Leithaus was eventually convicted of heresy and executed by the Inquisition).
According to Lauthaus, Gravi live as loners until they make their mating bid to another Gravis.
Should it be accepted, Gravi live the rest of their lives peacefully and monogamously together.
Aggresiveness is only observable while they are young - that is, looking for a mate.
Sexual dimorphism could not be observed in Gravi and it is questionable if there are any sexes at all, since almost nothing is known about their reproduction.

Gravis habitats were found mainly in forests with nearby rivers and high humidity.

### Schratgärtner

Schratgärtner belong to the Foeduculus due to their shape and at least basic intelligence.
The special thing about these monsters, which are about 3.5 meters tall, is that they practice a kind of agriculture, more on that later.

The Schratgärtner live virtually all their lives in seclusion in the caves that run through the basin of Yondalla, the adjacent mountain ranges as well as the caves around the southern slopes of the sky peaks.
They rarely leave these caves and thus hardly interact with the local population.

Schratgärtner occasionally leave their caves to look for firewood or generally combustible material to build small shelters or sleeping places with fireplaces in the caves, despite their solitary lifestyle.

Due to their size alone, they can pose a serious threat to even the best trained fighters and it is advised, unless you want to steal Schrat, to avoid these Foedukulus.

![Picture of a Schratgaertner](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Schratgaertner.jpg)

Schratgaertner often use rudimentary weapons which are made of sinew, resin, bones and stones from the environment or from stone and lindworms.

Their primary food source, although they are all eaters, is rats.
Schrat is gnarled mixture of fungus and plant and is grown and tended in "gardens" in the caves.
Schrat itself leaves, according to the tongues of the Rah Kari taste to be desired is suitable however excellently dried as Proviant for longer desert journeys.
Schrat gardeners, however, also grow schrat on their backs and eat it on occasion.
Schrat of the back is brown-red is called Gerant-Schrat and is suitable like the pitch-black Schrat itself for the production of Obvisker potions.
Schrat or Gerantschrat itself causes neither cooked nor raw the same effect as when created by alchemists from the right ingredients.

Since Obvisker potions are forbidden in Eldria and the Empire as they are among the Rah-Kari's, Obvisker potions fetch high prices.
The high prices are caused by the fact that the shad must be fresh, as well as the fact that a three and a half meter tall armed monster tries to turn you into shad fertilizer as soon as you get too close to his garden or himself or look at him at unfavorable moon phases.

There are no special tricks to fight or kill Schratgärtner and is not taught by the hand full specialists of the Rah-Kari as well as the Empire.
Prices on the black market suggest that only 4-8 level 3 Obvisker potions can be brewed from one Schrat Gardener.\
\
It is also recommended not to kill Schrat Gardeners for sustainable use, at least that is what an older Imperial Decree suggests.\
\
Anecdotally, only the translated report of Umag-Al-Orts-Top can be worth as a control manual
\

> "First, make sure that there are indeed Schratgärtner and not other monsters in the cave. Here it helps to roar loudly into the caves. If there is no sound from the cave, you can expect bandits, empty caves or stain worms. Bandits can be hit in the face with a hammer. Stainworms you run away and against Schratgärtner you put a huge fire in front of the cave, place several bags of rock flour in front of it and blow up the whole thing, as soon as the Schratgärtner throws stones at you the rock flour bags with a Moltovika.\
> \
> The gardener is then deaf and blinded for a while by the rock flour and usually in respiratory distress, whereupon you can break his skull with heavy war hammers, provided you have consumed forbearance potions and are not a weak human being
> It is not advisable to use spears or swords against the Schrat, because he usually steals them from the bearer and uses them against other enemies. Thus all caves in northern Yondalla are already with heavily armed Schratgärtnern a pure suicide command

> The brain of the Schratgärtner is to be eaten afterwards fast cooked around so to reach its forces and sien knowledge."\

## Beasts

### Kraves

Kraves are a plague that resemble an oversized raven and inhabit both cities and cave systems.
Although the average Krave cannot fly, the many variations of Kraves - as well as their viciousness - make them

> "The destruction of Wandia was horrific in many ways, but equally horrific were the stories that took place there afterwards. I myself saw the transformation that turned simple carrion birds into kraven: crows that spat the corrupted flesh of Awakened and grew larger and more aggressive. Soon they were too heavy to fly and developed almost human dimensions. They seized weapons and tools and raided whatever still-living flesh they could find."
>
> --- Hermetus Korak in "the fall of Wandia"

### Werewolf

Werewolves belong to the group of moderately intelligent monsters, which are spread throughout the world in slightly different varieties and are only not found in desert areas and the Gray Wasteland.
The appearance of werewolves is mostly a human-like stature.
The average height of their body is 2.2 meters.
Their body hair, which is strongest on the back and upper body, is usually gray to grayish blue.
Brown variants are more common in forests and swampy areas of the south.

Their physical strength and speed exceeds that of any trained orc.
Equipped with claws about 5 cm long, which are often partially broken in older specimens, they effortlessly tear open people.

The reproduction of terretorial werewolves occurs randomly throughout the year.
Here, mostly males roam around in search of females.
It often happens that werewolves also leave their ancestral territories and are sometimes sighted in villages.
So far, only sightings at night are known, where the werewolves roamed through villages.
Females give birth after an unknown length of time to about 3-6 young, which are raised on their teats.
The rearing period is usually several months where the female is often provided with additional prey by a male.

As soon as the young are about 11 months old, which corresponds to about 1.3 meters in height, they look for new hunting grounds under cover of darkness.

Werewolves are vulnerable to fire and poisons.

### mud drummer

Among the largest known representatives of the many-legged creatures are the mud drummers, found only in Silva Nacia's wetlands and the shallows of the Misty Grove.
They hibernate through the cold winter months, but are rarely found during this time, as these usually bury themselves in mud, sediment, or soil.

In the spring months, after the first warm days, these many-legged creatures still move extremely slowly and consequently are not a threat.
This time is ideal to eliminate these large creatures of the wetlands before they get close to settlements.

In practice, this works extremely poorly as the short phase is often overlooked.
Especially for the journeys through the misty grove, which are only undertaken by daring and experienced caravans anyway, the calmness of these mud drummers is a great advantage.

If you are confronted with a mud drummer, it is not recommended to fight it, but to flee at a run if possible.
These many-legged creatures are faster on water than on land.
For caravans, it is recommended to use scorpions or muskets, as the armor of these animals is extremely thick.
Close combatants should concentrate on distracting the beast so that the scorpion or musket can kill it.
Explicitly discourage the use of heavy armor, as this creature simply crushes people or eats them along with their armor.
In addition, it should be clear that near water in general the use of weighting material is unwise.

The nature of these creatures is simple.
They eat whatever is hiding in the mud or on the land and will not run away, or is stupid enough to confront these animals.
However, the abominations of the Misty Grove and Silva Nacia seem to provide sufficient food here.

> "So we were standing, you know, with 10 legionnaires, heavily armed at the border of this "grove of fog". Anyway, we saw the caravan coming, and thought, yeah well, the vanguard, 2 horses and the riders on it. But then we noticed that the carriages were not there, and that a few poor socks were running after the 2 horses. Well, I ordered my men to run against them. The visibility was relatively good for these miserable swamps in front of Rintom. Maybe 400 meters. So we ran towards them. Well, the heavy armor and the rain of the last days, you wouldn't believe how thick it can rain down there, didn't make the running easier. When the riders wanted to explain to us in broken imperial that we should turn back. Yes, you know, that we have not quite understood. What could harm 10 legionaries? Well, we continued to walk towards the merchants and in the fog we saw this huge beast. As high as a tower. Man, this thing was as wide as the villa of the old governor of Wagenfurt. We saw how the mouth of the thing was blood red and scraps of armor were hanging out. We took our legs in our hands, I was already fighting against eldritch pigs. But then my heart really fell into my ass. Shit, we ran and ran and this fog grove took no end. I was really glad to let my men run in heavy armor all the time. Flavius didn't make it, unfortunately, we heard the squeaking of armor as if it were thin sheet metal. One scream and it was silent. We ran and ran and that thing got smaller and smaller. I tell you. Even if the emperor himself shows up here, I won't stick a toe in the misty grove. Mud drummers were the name of these things, I've been told. No, I'll never go in there again, we got transferred and I have to tell them the story of my nephew Maxian...."

### Bony desert brawler

Among the dumbest of many-legged creatures are the almost humanoid-looking Bony Desert Thugs.

The approximately 2.5 meter tall many-legged creatures, which occur south of the Sky Peak Mountains, are equipped with 4 horns on their skulls, have 4 arms and 2 legs, as well as wings, which are presumably only suitable for regulating body temperature, since no flying Bony Desert Beaters are known.
They are subject to a yearly high variability in their frequency and cause thereby for caravans in Eid-Rah-kari and Apothis usually substantial problems if no trained fighters are present.

![Illustration of a Bony Desert Brawler](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/KnoechnerWuestenschlaeger.jpg)

The behavior of these many-legged creatures is extremely aggressive during the day and usually a resting phase at night where they bury themselves in the warm desert sand.
During the day, these abominations charge over long distances at caravans, desert scorpions, or anything that doesn't suit them that day.
On this occasion, desert bats have been observed several times ramming trees over and over again because a piece of cloth got caught in a tree.

The fight against the desert beaters should be done with spears and shields, without heavy armor.
The spears are used to reach the weak points under the back armor plates.
The shields are used to be thrown safely through the area by the approaching bony desert bruisers.
It is very important to stay motionless on the ground until another fighter distracts the brute and the brute rushes towards the fighter.
Good fighters master this game so well that they can eliminate desert bats in pairs.

During the onslaught, the desert beaters run on their arms and legs and are thus significantly faster than camels or humans.

The food of the desert beaters consists of sandworms and other many-legged creatures.

The exoskeleton of the Bony Desert Brawlers serves as cheap and ill-fitting medium-weight armor.
The two back plates, on the other hand, when joined together, make excellent shields, some of which are equal in value to iron tower shields.

The flesh of the desert beaters is not edible, but it burns extremely hot when dried and is used as fuel by some special smiths in Atumpet.

### Rockcrawler

These many-legged creatures inhabit the rough terrain of the Sky Peak Mountains.
These animals, with leg spans of several meters, are nocturnal and often hunt goats and cattle belonging to mountain farmers, and are known by the local population as mountaineering terrors.

They are extremely agile and skilled climbers and usually travel so silently that even behind sleeping men hardly anyone hears the tap of their heavily hairy leg soles.
Very little is known about their distribution and behavior patterns in the sky-top mountains, although they have been giving farmers sleepless nights for centuries.

Mostly the next morning there are reports of goats or cow carcasses slowly rotting on the steep slopes of the mountains and being gnawed on by ravens during the day.

In contrast to the wolf packs, which were severely decimated by the purge of 180 n.
Riga, rock creepers never kill more animals than are actually eaten or taken, so the loss of grazing animals does not approach the number caused by wolves at peak times.

Rock creepers have 2 extremely well-developed eyes and can thus move easily in the mountainsides even at night.
Partly these remain then for hours absolutely motionless in lurking position until an innocent cattle, or a lonely wanderer come too near.
Then the rock creeper jumps or sprints towards its prey.
Injects its venom, quickly paralyzing it.
It then sticks a kind of "sticky leg" on smaller victims to quickly bring the victim to safety, where they are then consumed on steep mountainsides.

![Depiction of a rock creeper, also known as a mountaineer's terror, in the Himmelspsitzen Mountains by Mangold von Straffeld](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Felsenkriecher.jpg)

Fighting rock crawlers proves to be extremely difficult due to their camouflage, inconsistent body structure, and hiding in rock crevices.
During the day, these many-legged creatures usually hide in crevices and caves, where they quickly act aggressively if disturbed and then flee - hence the name rock climber's terror.

Combating them is ideally done by skilled archers with thermal vision potions, which makes these actions an expensive undertaking and only some rich peasant cooperatives can afford them.

Less costly, on the other hand, is the support of forest or city elves equipped with bows.
Some skilled archers could earn 70,000 reiks within a month in the mountains (about 2,000 reiks reward for a killed rock creeper).
Most of the time, however, the density is too low due to resident hunters to be able to earn more than in the cities.

### Blue Mercantolite

Blue Mercantolites are native to the forests of Silva Nacia and have only 4 legs, but still belong to the multi-legged species.

These hunting endemics, equipped with dozens of eyes on their skulls, were called bone skullers just a few decades ago because of the bone plate on their heads.
However, their biology, reproductive and territorial behaviors suggest that they are normal large multibeasts.

Their body length is quite considerable at about 4-5m, but their stature reaches only about waist height.
They can be quickly frightened away by loud noises at night, as well as with an inserted "light of the all-god".
During the day, these creatures usually disappear into deeper crevices or cavities of larger trees, where they rest snoring and difficult to wake.

The mating season of the blue mercantolites is usually in late summer and here several males are found in rutting fights in specially cleared "arenas".
In most cases, these fights only involve threatening gestures and feigned attacks and rarely result in injury to the individuals involved.

During mating, the middle sticky blue tissue shred on the last body segment is attached to the middle upper dorsal segment of the female, where the tissue shred slowly melts and flows into the female's sexual opening.

The females allow the eggs to mature for about 4 weeks and then lay about 450 eggs in decaying trees in the immediate vicinity.
The females do not guard these clutches.
The eggs themselves have an extremely hard shell, making them consumed by few predators.

The hatched young grow over several years, reaching sexual maturity and full body size at around 5 years of age.

The diet consists of a mixture of anything that does not flee in time and is smaller than the mercantolith itself.
Cannibialism occurs with foreign fry.

Control of blue mercantolites can be done by a variety of methods.
The elves in Silva Nacia use ranged weapons and fight from trees.
The Imperial Army usually had the orc infantry and crossbowmen finish off these many-legged creatures and convert them into supplies for the soldiers.

If you are naively alone in Silva Nacia, you should make loud noises and swing a torch.
You should only flee if you are at least 50 meters away from these creatures, as they can sprint extremely fast over short distances, but then usually stop to catch their breath.

In groups heavy hammers should be used as only ide underside is less armored.
Ranged fighters should use hardened arrows or bolts or aim at the unarmored neck.

### Skrogan Scorpion {#Skrogan}

A Skrogan Scorpion is a large beast, a large scorpion native to Eid' Rah Kari.
Almost all ranged attacks - as well as many melee attacks - are ineffective against its armor.
This same armor is often used by the Rah Kari to craft armor for special units such as heroes or generals.

Wild Skrogan Scorpions are now rare, as the Rah Kari hunt them for their armor or domnesticate them for service in their units.
Skrogan Scorpions are more commonly seen in the armies of the Rah Kari.

![Hunting a Skrogan Scorpion is usually done with mounted archers](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/SkroganScorpion.jpg)

Skrogan scorpions, unlike their relatives the Silurian scorpions, are extremely cumbersome.
Thus, it is possible for the average human to outrun a Scrogan Scorpion on foot.
That is why these scorpions usually strike in terrain that is advantageous for them.
They prefer to live in hollows or very large holes where the slope or walls prevent their victims from escaping.
They pursue their victims over medium distances, which makes them susceptible to baiting strategies.

### Silurian Scorpion

Silurian scorpions, are not scorpions in the true sense but a seemingly very ancient variety of them.

Silurian scorpions are found almost exclusively in desert areas, but are sometimes found in the Gray Wasteland.
They grow up to 3.5 meters long, depending on their age.

Silurian scorpions are solitary and only meet to mate.
The eggs are not guarded and are edible when cooked.
The monsters are no more intelligent than general insectoid creatures and can usually be injured with ranged weapons, causing them to retreat back to the sand.
Their coloration usually matches the local sand where they move, sometimes digging slowly.
Their vision is poor, but they are extremely sensitive to vibrations.
Their venom is not particularly toxic, but the quantities are incredibly high - up to half a tankard of beer!

The Skropinoe are virtually invulnerable to fire and thus can NOT be fought with Moltovika or burning oil.
Moltovika, however, disorient the scorpions, so it is possible to kill them with spears.
Their meat, although relatively rare in Rahkari cities, is extremely sought after and can cost the equivalent of 4000 reiks per kilogram.
Their body armor makes excellent medium armor and is fabulously light.
However, you cannot maintain this armor without replacement armor.

Silurian Scorpions primarily prey on lone wanderers and so it is recommended to roam Silurian territory in at least four or five.

![Depiction of a Silurian Scorpion that just killed a desert glider that was forced to the surface by the heavy rains](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/silurianscorpion.jpg)

### Znitins

The 5-meter-span spiders in Silva Nacia are relatively rare, but they are important in the elven culture of Silva Nacia, as you can always find exsanguinated corpses wrapped in spider silk.
Although elves are skilled, even skilled scouts are outwitted by these spiders.
In principle, the Znitins are extremely skilled and fast, and surprisingly strong when confronted in close combat, but they can be quickly rendered harmless by the use of ranged weapons.
This means that in the thickets of Silva Nacia, good visibility areas are mandatory to overpower these monsters.

In close combat, it is recommended to use heavy shields, otherwise the blows with the long legs quickly lead to situations where the required sword suddenly lies between the legs of the spider.
The legs themselves are extremely strong and fireproof in the outer segments.
The hind body, on the other hand, is highly inflammable and extremely vulnerable.

For targeted culling of these eight-legged creatures, the open area described above and an ambush consisting of several ranged fighters and 3 supporting melee fighters is recommended.
Here, those not designed as "prey" should camouflage themselves visually and not move as well as possible.

As soon as the Znitins come out and are in sight they should be shot at as the melee fighter may be overwhelmed very quickly.
Especially if no shields are used.

The poison of the znitins paralyzes for an extremely long time and only the elves have known antidotes.
However, these remedies are only given to other elves for religious reasons.

The spiders are primarily active during the day, but they still see better than most elves at night, which makes killing the Znitins during the day the safer option.

The spiders are surprisingly intelligent and often simply retreat as soon as the situation seems uncomfortable to them.

### The Grawä Spider

The Grawä spider, called a riding spider by humans and dwarves, is a naturally occurring species of spider that inhabits the forests north and west of the Sky Peak Mountains.

The spiders live in monogamous pairs where females select mates. Although the males used to be considered a separate species, the observation of mating as well as the egg-laying a few months later was described by Andrian von Bergfäll. (here vlt a quote)
The coloration is characteristically brown-grey with doped stripes on the unarmored hind body of the spider. The area around the jaw claws, which work parallel to each other are pitch black and surrounded by a yellow-red hair fringe.
Like all spiders, the gray spider has 8 legs and is a formidable sprinter. However, its ability to sprint is offset by its lack of general stamina. This makes it difficult for spiders to get to their food - anything smaller and slower than them - in open terrain.
The spider's bite is extremely painful, even on small dog-sized specimens, and if left untreated often leads to death by poisoning. The spider species grows on her for life, which leads to matriarchs of tribes riding on spiders that sometimes span 10 meters. According to legends, the largest spider of Üräid the Wise was as big as all 600 members of the tribe lined up shoulder-to-shoulder.

The spider itself is naturally an active hunter. Aside from a backup spider thread, the Grawäspinnen do not produce webs. Accordingly, elves in spider silk armor are usually taken from other wild spider webs.
The spider is limited in night vision, but can slowly and roughly rely on its excellent sense of touch and vibration.
The spider's venom, neither formidable nor to be despised, is taken by skilled keepers to poison elven arrows and traps. This, of course, is not used for hunting, as the meat would then be inedible even for orcs.

The rearing of the young is done by both parents. The male spider is usually busy defending the young during the mother's hunt, but this becomes less significant after a few months, as the young spiders then begin to hunt themselves.

The name of the gray spider as a riding spider comes from the fact that wood elves have been breeding and domesticating this spider for a long time. The short generation time of the spiders, usually only 3 years lie between the egg-laying, the rapid adulthood of the spiders, as well as the monogamous partnership between the sexually mature animals leads to an ideal condition for the adaptation of the behavioral patterns of the animals.
The elves, who often live in tribes and have strictly divided "paths" there, thus adapt the spiders to the tasks of the respective path.
Thus, spiders of Silva Nacia's hunter and warrior caste are designed for jumping and fighting, while those of the "nature guardians" are designed more for carrying.


Since, according to elven tales, it is naturally common for male spiders to die frequently while defending their brood, the spider riders of the elves replaced this male. This allows the elf to develop a blasphemously close relationship with these animals over time.

Spiders that lose their elven or species mate for various reasons always show the same behavior pattern. For about a year they wake up at the burial place of their partner and gradually go wild. Thereupon they look for new hunting grounds. Such semi-feral spiders are described by the wood elves as Vöroäa's, which means "protectors of the forest", although they usually attack both elves and humans.

Among the natural enemies of this spider are the grotad wasps, first described in detail by Grotad of Kreuzberg. These hunt spiders over a "rideable" size of any kind and overpower the spider by means of their mobile hind body and the approximately 1.5 meter long stinger by means of paralysis venom. An egg is then laid in the paralyzed spider's hind body. From there, the hatching larva feeds on the paralyzed but still living spider. Elves always try to kill the solitary wasps immediately, which proves to be a difficult task, since these wasps only hunt the Grawä spiders at night and otherwise often retreat into burrows.

Since the Grawä spider must shed its skin regularly in order to grow, elves use the chitinous carapaces left behind as armor and the jaw claws as weapons. However, quite a few skins are needed to make a full set of armor, which can match from resistance with poor iron chain mail to outstanding steel chain mail. Thus, for the Wood Elves Silva Nacias, it is a special day when a Spider Rider wears a full set of armor from his "partner" after several years.

The fight against these eight-legged monsters should preferably NOT take place in a forest, as attacks can come from all sides.
It is recommended to fight mounted spiders during the day in open areas, targeting the soft hind body. Unmounted spiders should also be controlled in open areas and at night.
Bear traps are explicitly discouraged, as they are very rarely triggered, due to the spider's stilt-like legs.
Fire and a light of the Allgod to blind the spiders and keep them at a distance is to be advocated. The trick with the big torch in the hand is usually good enough to keep natural gray spiders at a distance. However, after a certain size, the mounted elven battle spiders lose their natural awe of fire.



## Slime

### Fungalite

Fungalites are known from the remains of Wandia and roam in groups through all known areas of Wandia. According to scholars, they are a terrible fungal disease that first puts victims into a coma and then turns them into a kind of fungal zombie for weeks.
The beer smell of the hereby constantly stronger remains also with renewed awakening.
After no cure is found for the fungal disease and all documented cases become fungal zombies, the fungalites should be treated with caution.

Affected individuals fuse extremely quickly with armor and weapons.
Unarmed victims usually develop a tendril about 2 meters long which causes toxic effects on hits.

Fungalites are clearly above regular Awakened in intelligence and usually cooperate with each other and are quite faster on foot than many an armored human.
The real danger, however, comes from the plague hosts, which are quasi-living bombs that often sneak up on you in the thick of things and then blow themselves up.
The resulting spores and gases infect all nearby humanoids and presumably also foeducules in a considerable radius.

Therefore, extreme care should be taken when fighting groups of fungalites.
It is recommended that the Fungalites be eliminated with a bow.
Fungalites are extremely flammable on the head.
The gases produced are extremely unpleasantly pungent and cause poisoning symptoms in the vicinity, which can be eliminated with level 1 potions.

## Bone Skinner

### Twins of the Abyss

The twins of the abyss, which belong to the bone skulls, are two seemingly identical creatures that always appear in pairs. They are huge, slender creatures that are about 15 meters tall and roam Wandia.

Their head is covered by the familiar bone plate and their chest area is also covered by bone plates, as are their shoulders.
The arms divide from the elbow into 2 forearms, which can be moved independently of each other.
The legs consist of bead-like tentacles and divide at the end into several smaller tentacles.
The back of the head has several small tentacles.
The function of these is unknown.

Also unknown is what the twins of the abyss eat as food, whether they can mate or be injured.

picture of the twins when they suddenly appeared on the surface in 872 n. Riga](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/ZwillingeDesAbgrundes.jpg)

Reported so far were 3 expeditionary parties that fought the twins or observed them fighting with other monsters.
The translated reports of the third Dwarf-Orcish expedition reports from ca.
1120 b. Riga should give a better insight.

> "In the lower eastern district of Wandia, after we eliminated the third wave of Fungalites without casualties suddenly at the place of the High Arts came these giant tentacle fighters. A 3 meter boulder was immediately hurled at us and Hurak-Gro, a 2 meter tall orc in heavy armor was turned into a pool of blood, while 2 dwarven archers lost their moving ballista. We split into 4 squads as usual and tried to take cover behind houses. This worked just fine until they suddenly stood at the houses and simply picked out our expensively recruited mercenaries like fruit and crushed them like ripe plums.

We were all hardy from the fight but for all I knew, it turned my stomach.

The second group began to throw their moltovika at the monster while the third group tried to distract the second.

The Moltovika made the monster turn around and went to the square with 3 steps- took the gold plated statue and used it as a club.
The Moltovika caused it to rain meat that in turn began to attack us again.
These small bone skulls also showed the typical bone plate and could be finished off by our melee fighters.
The Moltoivika, however, did not seem to care about the monster.

!(Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/SprossDerZwillingeDesAbgrundes.jpg)

The second giant also simply crushed the orcs in the heavy armor and then simply held more in his "second" hands and then simply left.
The first twin, which was thrown with moltovikas, turned around, threw the statue into the roof of the school of blasters and then the whole spat was over.
Arrows and bolts which we shot were stuck in the bodies but they just went back where they came from while we tried to free the 3 still living orcs in their hands somehow.
But their screams became quieter and quieter with each mighty step of the twins, because we could no longer catch up with them.

After that we tried to recover the statue in the roof of the blaster school to compensate our financial losses and since then none of our expeditionary force ever went back to Wandia.
Never again we wanted to see those twins \> \> --- Excerpt from the report of the third dwarf-ork expeditionary force to Wandia.
ca 1120 b. Riga

As the report describes impressively Moltovika could not do anything against the monsters and since then the lower eastern district of Wandia is considered a place for treasure hunters only for madmen.

When the twins suddenly appeared on the surface of Wandia about 2000 years later, they erected an altar or symbol with stone pyramids they had brought with them.
The twins were on the surface of Wandia for several weeks, destroying more of the ruins and taking out a squad of elves by attacking them with chunks, meat shearers of their own, and a tree trunk.
The eldritch lords then tried to gather an army, but in the end refused to attack the twins and let them prevail.
After a couple of weeks, the spook was over, but for all the adventurers, even years later, a bitter aftertaste remained.

In principle, it is advised to stay away from the known corridors which start from the eastern districts of Upper and Lower Wallia.

## Vampiridae

### Katakhan

Katakhans belong to the weaker Vampiridae and usually appear as loners.
They resemble ugly hybrids of bats and hairy goblins in appearance and are accordingly popular among the population.
Like all vampiridae, Kathakane suck blood.
The special thing here is that here the blood of the victims are absorbed through the claws and metabolized extremely quickly.
This means that the Kathakan can heal itself quickly in battle on victims what brought them among mercenaries the reputation of "immortals".

In principle, katakhans are nocturnal and accordingly hear and smell well.
Their vulnerability is to fire and narcotics.
If it is not convenient to burn down a forest, it is recommended to use sheep smeared with honey as a trap.
This should lure this limited intelligent bearded vampiridae out of hiding most of the time.

### Flesh Sucker

Although all Vampiridae actually "suck" blood, the Flesh Suckers are a special form here.
Their habitus is reminiscent of a broad-bodied human, with the left arm ending in several tentacles.
The body color is blue-gray and the lower abdomen usually has small openings where pieces of flesh are squeezed out.

Flesh suckers are not particularly tough fighters, but are surprisingly agile and extremely susceptible to light.
They are usually found near former battlefields where they suck the corpses and dying.
While these monsters can be quickly dispatched by skilled melee fighters or marksmen, the fact that they only attack at night is a complication to actually killing these monsters.

By the decree of 75 n.
Riga, the wounded must be treated on battlefields from now on to remove them from the battlefield.
The dead should be buried as soon as possible, as flesh-suckers are usually attracted in numbers from several dozen kilometers around, which can make them a threat to local security.
In peacetime, the number of sightings of meat suckers often decreases.
Presumably, they fall into some sort of interim hibernation, which is at least suggested by repeated observations.

The Empire, all Eldrian principalities except Austen, offer about 5000-10,000 reiks in bounty for a killed flesh sucker.

## Legends

A few monsters are so powerful or infamous that they have their own legends surrounding them, listed below are some of them

## Anomalies

### Ricor

The realm of the blood gods is reminiscent of a court of nobles. Nothing is indulged, and what one has, another must possess. Everyone wants to get the upper hand. So it happened that [Ga'ar](#Gaar), by creating monsters, made many other blood gods jealous, who in turn tried to create their own henchmen. Accordingly, [Ciresh](#Ciresh), the blood goddess of illusions, also wanted to create a representative for herself.
Her gaze fell upon the Ricor, an ancient monster that had existed for a long time. She began to influence Ricore and gave them the ability to create illusions themselves. These illusions feel to the victims of the Ricor as if they were reality and they perceive completely different impressions than the situation in which they actually are. The transition from reality to illusion usually goes unnoticed. The Ricor adapts the illusion to the real environment of the victim in such a way that the victim has as little reason as possible to question the illusion.
In an illusion, the victims smell, see, taste, and feel everything they could perceive if this situation were real. Accordingly, real feelings can also arise on the basis of which the victims of a Ricor make decisions. Thus, a person's behavior can be strongly influenced.

For Ciresh, Ricors are very suitable tools precisely because of their ability to influence people. By manipulating influential people, she can create political and social influence.
Ricore have a brownish, slightly furry skin that makes it easy for them to hide in forests or the undergrowth. They can walk on two legs as well as advance on all fours. Physically, Ricors are very weak creatures, which is why they rely on illusions for sustenance. The Ricor's appearance is also distinguished by a third eye, which it wears on its forehead. This eye is necessary to create illusions. With it, a Ricor creates the menacing black mist that surrounds him.

> While hunting the monster, a crossbowman hit the third eye of the Ricor and destroyed it completely. Initially, we thought that this was only a minor problem for the Ricor, however, since then reports of illusions have stopped completely - which was not the case with other captured Ricors. Therefore, it can be assumed that the third eye of the Ricor is the most important tool.
>
> --- Excerpt from the essay "The Horror of the Sable Forest - Treatises on the Ricor" by Eidmann Zaneh

Ricors live all over Orbis Astea, since they do not prefer any specific habitat. They are solitary creatures and survivalists, making long-term settlement in one place unnecessary. However, it is significant that Ricore only stay in one place until there is no more food for them to find, or the social situation - for his mistress Ciresh - has been sufficiently destabilized.
To be able to create illusions in his victims, a Ricor needs a certain spatial proximity to them at the beginning. This amounts to a distance between 0 and 800 m. Distances beyond that prevent the establishment of contact. Ciresh uses this limitation to keep track of where her henchmen are. Once a connection has been made with a victim, however, the physical distance to a Ricor is irrelevant. From there on, he can repeatedly create illusions in a person and thus control them.

For the Ricor itself the control of the illusioned serves beyond that to the weakening of the persons, in order to be able to hunt them down more easily as victims for food. Because an illusion extinguishes without that the return into the reality is steered by the Ricor, a strong state of confusion is caused. Ricors make use of this moment of defenselessness to attack.

llusions of a Ricor can be diminished by inflicting pain or drinking a special potion. Since a ricor cannot make sounds within its illusions, experienced monser hunters try to pay close attention when they have reason to believe they are facing a ricor. Because if a person can hear the sounds in its perceived environment situation-faithfully, then it is certainly not in an illusion - it happens however that Ricore, due to this fact, cause other disturbing noises, in order to overshadow the missing sense impression.
The influence of a ricore is more noticeable to outsiders than to the person affected, since the changes in behavior or opinion caused by the illusions often come as a surprise.

Unfortunately, these weaknesses of ricors are known only to experienced monster hunters and scholars. Only a few people even know about the existence of the Ricore, because persons who followed their illusions and ended up in the clutches of a Ricor mostly did not survive this encounter.

Almost every traveler is familiar with the story of the invisible bridge of the Bonefield Gorge. According to this story, there is a small hidden passage in the Bonefield Gorge, which is supposed to make it possible to bypass dangerous parts of it. The famous dwarven merchant Belegar supposedly used this secret passage to gain great wealth by selling goods from both sides of the mountain.
This myth wanders around especially in trade guild circles and ensures that to this day many young merchants still try to find this hidden path. Most of them unsuccessfully. Nowadays, scholars assume that this path could be the work of a ricor, who especially makes traveling merchants his victims here, and that the invisible bridge does not exist in reality.

In expert circles it is strongly discussed whether Ricore control single persons in order to lure other persons into their sphere of action, so that they can establish a connection to them. This approach would argue for an evolution of Ricore hunting tactics. It would also suggest that the Ricore have become physically weaker and weaker over generations through the use of the illusions and are now entirely dependent on them for survival.
