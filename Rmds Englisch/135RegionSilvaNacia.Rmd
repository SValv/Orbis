### The flora and fauna {#SilvaNaciaForest}

One of the most impressive plants of the Silva Nacia forest are the Merulius porosporus.


This fungus grows only in dark, windless areas to keep its own spores as local as possible so that they do not spread throughout the forest. This has the peculiarity that the spores of the fungus, when in contact with people, causes them to lose control over their impulses and thus can no longer control themselves, which leads to the madness of the people. The advantage for the elves here is that they are immune to the effect of the fungus.


Furthermore, in addition to the many different types of trees and mushrooms, there are also small and large carnivorous plants, whereby the small ones can cause injuries, while the large ones can consume entire people. While the small plants are widely known, these are documented in much greater detail.

In contrast, the large plants are also specifically planned in their location on the paths for people entering the forest.

In addition, there are huge dandelions and spore bushes that allow you to restrict your opponent's vision, giving you a targeted combat advantage.
