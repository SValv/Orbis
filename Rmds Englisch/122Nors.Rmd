# Nors

The cold region of Nors lies above the Heartland and is the only part of the Empire that has the privilege of access to the sea and its resources.
South of the <font color="green">[Ice Country]()</font> and North of the <font color="green">[Sky Peak Mountains]()</font>, Nors is climatically rather cold and damp, and so it is absolutely necessary to arm yourself against the cold when visiting in the winter months.

As in most parts of the empire, the inhabitants of Nors originally did not believe in the All-God. However, through the efforts of missionaries, most of Nors' citizens were eventually converted to the one true faith of our world. Like the Heartland, Nors played an important role in the founding as well as the success of the Empire, that the founding country of the Empire is also the most important carrier and exporter of various metals for the Empire.

## History of Nors

Today, it is widely believed that the first inhabitants of Nors were refugees: Peasants, craftsmen and former soldiers who had enough of the constant conflicts of the noble families of the Heartland and wanted to seek a better life in a new region. It is said that the first settlers in Nors fled because of a conflict. Unable to cross Lake Reik, they decided to follow the river towards the ocean instead, which eventually led them to the Nors region. The river they encountered as the first obstacle - today's Reik - became the birthplace for the first settlement.

Despite the fact that their new home had a decent space, natural resources and portential for expansion, many people were not satisfied with the distance they had gained from the heartland. After only 2 years, a new expedition group was formed, which included 27% of the population of Riga. This expedition continued the trend of following the Reik, which led them to finally reach the ocean. Here they decided to establish the second settlement in Nors, the present city of Storm Cape.

As time went on, more and more villages were established in Nors, and with these villages came more infrastructure to the region. Normally, one would think that the capital of a region is the reason for its prosperity. In this regard, Nors is a little different, as it was the new villages that allowed Nors to properly mine the natural resources that the Heartland lacked. Due to the fact that Nors was located in a part of the world where it was more difficult to get food, a variety of trade routes were established with the Heartland, where Nors supplied most of the Heartland with metals and other various goods that were not available there, while in return the Heartland supplied Nors with food and other goods essential to human life.

Over time, Nors as a region gained more and more influence among the nobles of the Heartland, and although the settlers there were only a few generations old, many of them had forgotten the reasons why they had left their old land behind. Due to this fact and the increasing influence the Heartland nobles gained through trade, the Thrax family declared itself the first noble family of Nors in the year of 142 before the Battle of Riga. This, in turn, set off a chain reaction that led to the families that were strong enough to declare themselves nobles as well.

The next years are marked by wars, non-aggression pacts, alliances and friendship declarations of the new nobles of Nors, who began to resemble more and more the nobles of the Heartland. However, after the foundation of the Empire by Virius Proximus, many of the families of Nors joined the new confederation.

### Jaronson Nors - the founders of a city

Although the name Nors can be classified as climatically northern due to the coldness of the northern sea, it has nothing to do with it, contrary to common belief.
Nors is one of the oldest inhabited areas and used to be a trading hub. According to an undated, but very old document, Nors is called by name the city of Jaronson Nors. Jaronson's Nors was the documented city ruler or prince at the time and his bloodline ruled the developing city and also the surrounding lands for about 300 years.
Although no direct descendant of the Nors dynasty can now be found for over 600 years, the city retained its name.
Since its incorporation into the Empire, the princes who ruled at that time are in any case only a shadow of their former glory. Jaronson Nors and his descendants, on the other hand, remain in their name through this probably the most significant factor of influence in the history of Nors.

Among other things, he succeeded in:

Incorporation of the iron and silver mines at the foot of the Heavenly Peaks.
Construction of a solid city wall.
Preservation of peace with the princes of Strumkap
Abolition of the blood feud
Creation of a rudimentary sewage system.

These achievements lie far in the mists of the past, but have been preserved for posterity by diligent librarians.

## Economic situation in Nors

Nors' economy is based primarily on specific resources that are not found, or are difficult to find, in other parts of the empire. These resources include salt found in both the mountains and waters of Nors, various metals found in the mines scattered around Nors, and some specific spices native to the Nors region. The metals found in Nors are either shipped directly to other cities such as Civis Primae or Riga, or processed in Nors by many skilled craftsmen into armor, weapons, or other goods.
Furthermore, Nors is also considered the main salt exporter of the empire.
Many of the goods imported to Nors consist of food and drink, as Nors has difficulty producing these goods itself due to its not very fertile soil.

Much of the Empire's military equipment is also manufactured in Nors. This is done in large part due to its proximity to the resources needed to make it. In addition, production in Nors also ensures that the many troops stationed in the western part of Nors (mainly near the Bonefield Gorge) are ready for any future threat from the Rak Kari.  

Finally, it should also be mentioned that many merchants and trading companies engaged in long-distance trade find Nors a starting or ending point for many routes.

### Kether tag

There is not a single child in Nors who does not know about the cultural significance of the kether. With the power to fight the mightiest of men, this fish proves a worthy challenge to even the most experienced of anglers.

The kether occupies a special place in Nors society to the extent that it even has its own holiday, as it has filled the bellies of many people in times of poor harvests.
Every tenth month of the year the kether return to the shores of Nors and to the Reik - to Deep in the Reik Lake, where they stay for about 6 weeks. According to experts, when the mating season comes, adult kether make their way back to their birthplace. With a weight that is usually close to the Reik.
Since these fish quickly weigh 35-50 kg, often a single catch is enough to feed a small village for a day. Therefore, many in Nors celebrate the beginning of the tenth month and the arrival of the kether - and with it the peak of fishing in the year. Especially in smaller villages, catching a kether is a status symbol and, especially among young men, one of the most important chances to distinguish oneself as a good fisherman and catch the biggest fish.

While this celebration used to be one of the biggest festivals, due to food imports from the Heartland, the flow of food has become more stable, which has led to the fact that the kether is now celebrated traditionally mainly in smaller villages and not so much in the larger cities, where the kether day has degenerated more into a binge than a celebration of fishing. However, those who grew up in Nors know about the kether and its meaning, and even today some people in Nors wear signs of this fish as a necklace, on their clothes or decorate their houses with it.
