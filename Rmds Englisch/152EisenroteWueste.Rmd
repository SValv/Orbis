# The Iron Red Desert {#IronRedDesert}

Few regions of the world we know are as little known as the Iron Red Desert, and the reasons for this are many. But let's start with what we do know: The region lies close to Rah Kari controlled territory and we inhabited by a mixture of orcs and humans who call themselves the **"Trattoi "**, the area consists of extremely fertile soil and provides a natural border with the Rah Kari called Wormfall.

## Wormfall

The only reason why this disorganized people, with no military strength to speak of, have been able to resist the Rah Kari invaders for so long is because of the region that surrounds them. Wormfall is not only the nightmare of every wanderer but also of every cartographer.
Wormfall is inhabited by the eponymous giant sandworms, which react to vibrations, making it almost impossible to cross with transport vehicles or larger troop units. Furthermore, many other dangerous creatures can be found there.

The progress is further complicated by quicksand rivers that run through the plains.
But what really makes this region hell is the feature that has earned it the nickname **Burning Desert**, in about a quarter of a year the volcano under the region quakes, its eruptions collapse the corridors of the sandworms, this for the whole map and all landmarks change also shoot fire columns from the ground whose smoke darkens the sky, much to the friend of the nocturnal monsters.
However, it is at this time that the Rah Kari start their expeditions through the region, because the sandworms cannot perceive the troop trains due to the vibrations. The worms themselves are hardly affected by the heat due to their thick skin.

## Villages of the region
Wurmfall has no towns worth mentioning due to its dynamically changing landscape
The Iron Red Desert, on the other hand, has a few notable oases controlled by the largest factions of the Trattoi and a number of less relevant ones.


### Infrastructure
The individual oases are independent self-sustaining systems, but trade is conducted between individual tribes, preferably between allies of one's own faction.

## History of the region

The history of the region is, apart from small skirmishes for the supremacy over some areas, only characterized by the regular expansion attempts of the Rah Kari Empire.

## Economic situation

### The resources of the region

Contrary to the image one has of a desert in one's mind, the Iron Red Desert is full of valuable resources. These are the main reason for the repeated conquest excursions of the Rah Kari. From nutrient-enriched water to valuable ores, the desert offers everything an emerging desert empire could desire.

Due to the volcano located under Wurmfall, the nutrients regularly enter the groundwater, which provides rich vegetation in the places where it comes to the surface again.

## Conquests of the Rah Kari

The expeditions of the Rah Kari always start at the time of the burning desert, because in this period they can use the transport wagons without fear of the sandworms, but this is accompanied by the increased risk of attacks of other monsters, collapses in the ground and fire eruptions.
The Rah Kari forces are supported by desert tribes. While the desert tribes hope to gain booty in the form of water that will grow their oases, the Rah Kari are interested in the riches that occur.
Each expedition lasts about 3 months, during which time the army must cross the Wormfall, only to be involved in near daily battles with the Trattoi, who do everything they can to treasure their terrai. If the expedition troops survive these 3 months and loot has been secured the long and dangerous march back through the Wormfall will begin.



## Sociopolitical situation

### Domination system/organization
Structures only develop around the oases; only a few tribes are able to keep more than one oasis permanently under their control. However, due to the repeated attacks of the Rah Kari, factions have formed among the tribes that support each other in fending off the invaders.
