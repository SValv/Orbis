Eldria is more a name for a region than a faction: a region that lies to the east of the Heaven's Peak Mountains.
However, the various principalities of Eldria consider themselves allies - almost kin, in fact. But like any family, the principalities cannot get along without quarreling. Alliances and hostilities are constantly changing.
The largest and most powerful principalities are <font color="green">[Aerlham](#Aerlham)</font> and <font color="green">[Ghent](#Ghent)</font>. Usually common eldritch actions are controlled from there. However, Austen and Hasting are also large and influential principalities.

According to estimates, Eldria consists of over 300 principalities, with only the largest 6-10 being relevant. Some of the principalities are only sub-principalities of more important principalities, to which they owe allegiance and loyalty. Others are independent minor principalities, which - in order not to be taken over by the other, larger principalities - form alliances.


## The History of Eldria {#The History of Eldria}

### The Kingdom of Eldria

Exactly when Eldria came into being is a knowledge that has unfortunately been lost. However, nowadays it is suspected that Eldria was a major project of the ominous dwarven clan called <font color="green">[the Thunder Guardians](#Thunder Guardians)</font>.
Like the society of the Thunder Guardians, Eldria was also a kingdom whose giant capital <font color="green">[Wandia](#Wandia)</font> was many times larger and more impressive than Atumpet and Civis Primae combined in its heyday. Wandia was inhabited on the surface by the Eldrians and underground by the Dwarves, and in many ways was run together.

The ruler of Wandia was, as it were, also the ruler of all Eldria. He created the administrative structures and domains that today make up the nobility, principalities and vassal ladders. All united under the crown of Wandia.

In this golden age of Eldria - long before the Empire even existed - Eldria was arguably the strongest and greatest human empire Orbis Astea had ever seen. Through the Thunder Guardians it flourished technologically and economically, through the Eldrian knightly culture it became a military power that was even able to establish diplomatic relations with the <font color="green">[Elves of Silva Nacia](#Thunder Guardians)</font> - a friendship that culminated in the Elves giving a seed of the sacred tree to the Wandia royal family.
It was nothing short of a miracle that this seed sprouted in Wandia, and there sprouted the only offshoot of the sacred tree to this day - a miracle that bound the elves and the kingdom of Eldrias in friendship.

The kingdom of Eldria was not very expansive and, apart from trade with the inhabitants of the lower steppes, had little contact with the other - largely non-existent - human kingdoms.

The fall of the kingdom came with the fall of Wandia, when in 1150, before Riga, a mighty true dragon fell upon Wandia, turning the city into a pile of rubble. The Deep City was also destroyed, with many Thunder Guardians and the entire royal house of Eldria losing their lives.

### The Splintering {#The Splintering}

Without the power of Wandia and the leadership of the royal house, the principalities of Eldria broke apart and the first Eldrian civil war began over power, territory, and resources. The unrest was further exacerbated by the True Dragon, which incinerated anything that came too close to Wandia, and by the elves of Silva Nacia, who could not forgive the Eldrians for the loss of the Tree Seedling and now regularly invaded Eldria with their own troops.

Soon, two factions were able to prevail in the civil war. Aerlham in the north of Eldria and Gent in the south - the largest principalities of Eldria to this day.

In time, other local principalities also strengthened through clever exploitation of alliances and mutual backing. Thus, Calvert, Austen, Darcy, Hasting, Rinton, and Haag also became politically independent and relevant.

In the long run, all principalities managed to bind vassal lords and knights to themselves - some more, some less stably - and thus to consolidate their own power.

In the next centuries there were more and more civil wars in Eldria. This made the Eldrians more concerned with their internal disputes than with foreign expansion, which is why there are no major campaigns of Eldria to report here.
Ghent and Aerlham balanced each other out, and whenever it seemed that one of the principalities would be able to assert itself, this was corrected by the changing alliances of the smaller principalities, which were afraid that one of the sides might become too strong.

Around 950 before Riga the so-called <font color="green">[Battle of the Colossi](#Thunder Guard)</font> occurred, which ensured that the true dragon could no longer terrorize Eldria.

### The effect of the rockfall

After several centuries, the rockslide of Istval occurred. A dwarven kingdom exploded and with it a part of the celestial peaks. The rivers and streams that were forcibly diverted as a result flowed into the valley, creating the <font color="green">[Mist Grove](#Mist Grove)</font> that separates the realm of Rah Kari from Eldria today.

Another effect of the rockslide was the devastation and large-scale destruction of the principalities south of Ghent. Large parts of Hague were destroyed, while other principalities perished completely. This was a great weakening of Ghent's position, since the affected principalities were largely vassals of Ghent.

As a result, Aerlham took the leading role among the principalities - although it cannot be equated with actual leadership. Aerlham is only the largest and most influential of the principalities. However, the others follow only as far as they want. Ghent is still enormously powerful and one of Aerlham's greatest adversaries.

However, Aerlham briefly occupied the home of the halflings, Yondalla, in 190 after Riga.

### The Imperial Occupation {#The Imperial Occupation}

For 8 years now, Eldria has been occupied by the Imperials. In the Battle of Aerlham, the Eldrian Grand Army was lost, a sort of assembled army of all the principalities.
Although Eldria will not be able to recover from this blow anytime soon, the resistance to the Empire is omnipresent. While some parts of Eldria are in open rebellion, most have guerrilla organizations on the move trying to stop or hinder the Imperials. Still other lords are actively siding with the Empire in hopes of expanding their own position and power.

## Eldria's Society


### The Princes

Nobility in Eldria is usually granted through inheritance. Sometimes, however, the title is granted by being given land and a title by a greater lord. This process is called "elevation" and is usually accompanied by a debt to the lord who elevated you.

![Cravin of Ghent](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/General.jpg)

Although there are many nobles in Eldria, their status is very important to them. Even small and completely insignificant nobles, whose influence is not really different from commoners, will insist that they are princes, and therefore demand respect that other nobles will also give them. Thus, nobles are generally given preferential treatment in captivity or trials.

### The Knighthood

The warriors of Eldria are among the best in the world. Both mounted and on foot, they are deadly, and the disciplines of individual combat are deeply embedded in Eldrian culture. A knight of Eldria can, in principle, become anyone who professes to be one. However, it is advantageous to have a mount and suitable equipment if you want to be taken seriously.

Knights often seek work with lords who can pay them. Although they often style themselves as heroes, they are actually not much better than conditional mercenaries. There are more than enough examples of knights switching sides for pay or land, or of knights mistreating or massacring civilians. Despite this, there are several forms of heroic epic about knights and they are considered heroes, so onlookers in villages may well surround them.

![A knight of Eldria, the Lion of Calvert adorns his crest [^UmbatmanBlackmoorsKnight]](Pictures/Flavor/Eldria/blackmoors_knight_by_umbatman.jpg)

Most knights wear a surcoat over their armor that displays in bright colors both the crest of the knight himself and the insignia of the lord they serve - if they are in a permanent relationship.

Usually it is particularly loyal knights who are elevated to the peerage. Thus, the knighthood is attractive to many social climbers or lesser nobles who aspire to more land and power and hope to gain actual influence through a possible elevation.


## The Principalities

### Aerlham {#Aerlham}

Aerlham is the most powerful and largest of the principalities. It is often referred to as the capital of Eldria.
Similarly, Aerlham is the northernmost principality and directly borders the Imperial Borderlands. Aerlham has the largest population of all the principalities and is the best city if you are looking for fancy crafts. Another unique, though rather unusual, feature is that Aerlham is one of the only cities in Eldria with a functioning sewer system.

The principality owes its power and rank to its strategically good position near the borderlands. The new enmity with the elves resulted in the loss of the route through the Silva Nacia. Thus the roads through Aerlham became the only useful route to the north, which Aerlham knew how to exploit to the full with tariffs and trade treaties. The Istval rockslide made this route even more important, cementing Aerlham's supremacy. Although Aerlham has often been subject to internal power struggles in its history, the Graham family managed to establish itself (with much help from Darcy) 200 years ago. As a result, Aerlham remains one of the most loyal members of the League of Light to this day.

Aerlham was controlled by the Graham family until the takeover by the Empire. Currently, however, the Imperial Stadtholder - and uncle of the Emperor - Arminius Prodius is in charge of Aerlham. He and his garrison rule the city, which is under martial law, with an iron hand, which means that even innocent people end up in a cell in Aerlham and trials are of secondary importance.

![A painting of Aerlham from the year 116](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Aerlham.jpg)

Despite these adverse circumstances, Aerlham's elite live a more than extravagant life in which balls, operas, masquerades, and other opportunities to distinguish themselves are part of everyday life. There is hardly any place where social inequality is as great as in Aerlham.

To this day, there is a growing resistance movement under Argus Graham, the youngest scion of the former ruling house. The latter built up the resistance against the empire in Aerlham.

### Gent {#Gent}

Along with Calvert, Gent was one of the two principalities established to protect Wandia and had an early military focus. Ghent's armies were elemental in beating back the enemies of the Thunder Wardens in the <font color="green">[Dwarven War](#Dwarven War)</font>. However, Ghent soon showed itself to be more headstrong than other principalities.
After the fall of Wandia, Ghent almost immediately declared its independence and began to expand its influence into surrounding principalities.

![The coat of arms of Ghent is adorned with the so-called Cross of Ghent](Pictures/Flavor/Eldria/Wappen/WappenGent.jpg)

This expansionist policy of Ghent soon led to a rivalry and enmity with Aerlham that continues to this day. This enmity resulted in countless skirmishes and wars.
The rockslide of Istval weakened Ghent and forced it to give up all hopes of taking over the leading role in Eldria in the near future.

Ghent was one of the principalities - the largest, to be exact - that joined the Empire after the war. This had the main advantage of allowing the Strake family to continue to rule Ghent. Of course, Ghent is not *really* loyal to the Empire. Thus, in the Great War, they fought the Imperials with everything they had. They are much more concerned with keeping their power uncomplicated and expanding it further, while fighting the Empire from behind with all available means.

Of all the principalities of Eldria, Ghent is certainly the one whose military is the most impressive. From a young age, Ghent's men are required to serve in the military and are integrated into the army. At the same time, Ghent is the only principality that does not only rely on knighthood for professional soldiers, but also on the classical soldier and the cooperation of units and troops, which makes Ghent incredibly strong in battle.
Of course, this does not mean that the Knighthood of Ghent is in any way inferior to the other principalities: The Knights of Ghent are especially feared and considered to be especially strong in battle, if not especially honorable.

![The Walls of Ghent](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Gent.jpg)

Culturally, Ghent is rather underdeveloped. While most other principalities at least put some of their resources into science, arts, and the preservation of knowledge, you won't find anything of the sort in Ghent.

Because of Ghent's central location, it is one of the most income-rich principalities in Eldria. Most merchants must also pass through Ghent on their way through Eldria, or at least through areas that Ghent controls. Due to the fact that Ghent makes every merchant pay customs duties, they pay for their expensive army and their generally rather unproductive economy.

Ghent is also that principality which has been religiously least touched by Darcy's church. Although there are some followers of the light, most people in Ghent are followers of a polytheistic primal religion that believes in the struggle of the gray gods.

### Austen {#Austen}

> "If it doesn't grow in Austen, it won't grow anywhere."
>
> --- Old eldritch proverb

Austen is the most arable area in Eldria, which is why the majority of its inhabitants are farmers. While this abundance of resources has always made Austen an important hub, it has also made it a target that other principalities have sought to dominate. Because of this, Austen spent most of its history under the occupation of Aerlham or Ghent until it eventually became its own imperial administrative zone. Because of this habituation to occupation, Austen has some of the lowest levels of hostility toward the Empire.

There is no traditional prince in Austen, only the supremacy of the Great Farmers' Union, in which the peasants with the 10 largest farms have a vote.

### Hasting {#Hasting}

Hasting is the principality closest to Silva Nacia and therefore has the most problems with the elves there. As a result, Hasting's knights and young men are often on the hunt for elves, whether they are elves of Silva Nacia or poor city elves.

### Darcy {#Darcy}

Darcy is home to the largest cathedral in Eldria: the Chromatia Narista is considered by most who have visited Darcy once to be one of the most impressive wonders in the world. It is the focal point of Darcy's Religion of Light, who believe in divinity in the observance of the chivalric code of honor.
Darcy houses the largest schools for young clergy and, unlike the usual principalities of Eldria, is not ruled by a noble, but by a spiritual ruler elected by all the priests of Chromatia Narista.

Darcy tries to avoid wars most of the time and therefore has various peace treaties with surrounding principalities, elven communities and even with some orc tribes.
Furthermore, Darcy has a lot of indirect influence on other principalities, as a solution is produced in Darcy that prevents the Awakening. This solution is called "Dream of the Blessed" and is a water specially consecrated by priests of Chromatia Narista, which is the most efficient known solution to prevent revival.
Darcy tries to use the sale of this remedy to coerce other principalities into cooperation and peace treaties, although in part none of the disputing parties want peace - let alone Darcy's interference in their affairs. This aggressive policy has also ensured that Darcy and his religion are nowhere near as popular or influential in the outside world as other denominations in Orbis Astea whose solution to revival are more complex than Darcy's religion.

![The Cathedral of Darcy](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/dARCY.jpg)

Most nobles send their second-borns to Darcy for training as a symbolic act. On the one hand, it is a sign of peace and understanding among the principalities. On the other hand, the second-borns then represent educated, loyal and good advisors for their big brothers.

### Calvert {#Calvert}

The Principality of Calvert is the oldest minor principality in all of Eldria and has been ruled by the Calvert family for over 1000 years.
The Calverts were instituted at that time by the royal family as a protectorate of Wandia, and to this day are bound by an oath to protect the royal family, which must be sworn upon elevation to prince.
This long bloodline and tradition - as well as the sworn oath - also ensure that Calvert is clearly more interested in reclaiming Wandia than other principalities of Eldria. All too often, the Calverts send half their armies to their deaths in pursuit of orcs, elves, and anyone else who wants to claim Wandia for their own.

![The Throne Room of Calvert](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Calvert.jpg)



### Rintom and Haag {#Rintom and Haag}

Although Rintom and Haag are two different princely romans in themselves, they are very related, which is why they are treated together in this book. Both city-states are located directly on the Misty Grove. Over time, this has strongly influenced the psyche and society of the inhabitants, as well as the politics of the city-states. While in the rest of Eldria, hospitality is an important virtue, in Rinton or Haag it is very unlikely that one will be welcomed as a guest. The power of the security forces is almost infinite, and searches of passersby are commonplace. The paranoia within the cities is only surpassed by the fanatical following of the "Keepers of the Grove," who hold daily and obligatory masses of purification intended to protect against the Grove's exhalations.

![View from the streets to the citadel of Haag](Pictures/Flavor/Placeholder/Haag.jpg)

In both cities, there were and still are systematic witch hunts that mainly target drug addicts and alchemists. The largest of these was in 184 after Riga, in which over 400 people were publicly burned - all under the supervision of the Keepers of the Grove.

> "Of all the principalities you can visit, avoid those that lie along the Grove of Fog. The inhabitants are cold and unfriendly, and everywhere there is a green haze in the streets. Some days the fog is so thick that you can't even see two handbreadths. While the rest of Eldria is rather sunny and warm, Rintom and Haag are still gloomy and unlivable even on the brightest summer days."
>
> --- From "The Travels of Emhyr na Ren"

The principalities on the Misty Grove, unlike the other principalities, have a small population and little military power. The only reason a stronger principality has not yet annexed them is the ambivalence of the Misty Grove. This makes it possible, with the right fog development, to carry out an enormous amount of unexpected surprise attacks and make whole armies untraceable, both during a retreat and when marching - provided you know the area.
Despite their low military power, however, the two city-states are enormously important political and economic locations, as their proximity to the Empire of the South is not to be underestimated, both for trade relations and for military reasons.


## The Eldrian Military

The Eldrian military consists of knights and draftees. While the knights are sometimes the best warriors in Orbis Astea, the draftees are often miserably trained and equipped.

## Eldrian Legends

Eldria is a land of myths and legends: from hedge knights and upright knights slaying robber barons and monsters, to legends of the <font color="green">[Mist Grove](#Thunderguard)</font> and <font color="green">[Wandia](#Thunderguard)</font>, which can be read in their respective chapters.
