## Die Geschichte der Region

In the depths of Himmelspitzen Gebirge, the dwarves stake their claim as the oldest humanoid race on the continent. However, no one can confirm this, and skeptics believe it originated from a campaign around 270 years ago to elevate the dwarves' reputation. In this endeavor, the physically sturdy dwarves were portrayed as serious, wise, and, in a somewhat contentious choice of words, "all-knowing. But it is undoubtedly believed that the dwarves are an ancient race. Ruins of their once widely spread cities in Himmelspitzen Gebirge, crafted into the worm-ridden tunnels beneath, indisputably attest to longer traces of their existence.

Extracting information from dwarves is no easy task, as they universally demand payment for the one-sided exchange of information. According to ancient inscriptions and paid dwarven historians, the "first" Umgar royal lineage was known as "the Red." However, dating is impossible due to archives collapsing and burning during earthquakes. Presumably, the dwarves lived in strong cooperation under the iron hand of the Umgar lineage in the mountains and earth of Himmelspitzen Gebirge.

The dwarven folk, once united under the red banner of Clan Umgar, dedicated themselves to accumulating resources, exploring Orbis, and seizing all valuable things within reach. The dwarven folk, once united under the red banner of Clan Umgar, dedicated themselves to accumulating resources, exploring Orbis, and seizing all valuable things within reach. The Clan Umgar was even accused of hoarding all these treasures, suggesting that there was no actual task. With this thought, the revolution ignited. In each of the now numerous and well-connected dwarven cities, conflict erupted. "Progressives" against the Royalists proudly raising their royal red banners, with the latter significantly outnumbered. The dwarves' hearts were too deeply entrenched in greed. During this time, known among historians only as the End of Sharing, the tunnels filled with dwarven blood. Many dwarven cities did not survive this civil war and are now nothing but ruins, delving deep into the earth. Others collapsed entirely under the weight of war, burying entire clans, and still others were weakened to the point where the cities could no longer withstand attacks from other races that coveted their wealth. The Clan Umgar itself splintered into many small pieces scattered across all cities. However, the royal lineage survived, albeit stripped of its power.

After the civil war new ideas sprouted among the dwarves, and they became known as the "freshly hatched dwarves." This distinction caught the attention of orcs and Rah Kari, emphasizing the meticulous nature of the dwarves. Every word and action carried weight, and documentation became a cornerstone of their existence, a departure from the conventional ways of the Rah Kari merchant caste. This, inadvertently, led to restrictions on permits for dwarven traders moving outside the main cities, putting pressure on local "disorganized" traders. The Kaiserreich and the loose Eldrier alliance faced similar challenges, as dwarves, when tolerated, suddenly amassed the entire wealth of a village in their small hands.

As the dwarves turned inward, their economic system evolved. The drive for wealth, now confined by the limited space, pushed them to refine their skills and knowledge. In this crucible of scarcity, the dwarves became true masters of trade and craftsmanship. However, the Rah Kari, Eldria and even the Kaiserreich were cautious in their dealings with dwarven traders, who, despite their size, held immense economic power. Despite their civil war, the dwarves remained connected to the Empire and Rah Kari lands through an extensive tunnel system. This intricate infrastructure facilitated the movement of caravans, connecting the dwarven capital to major trade routes. The economic strength of Himmelspitzen Gebirge relied on the precious metals, ores, and salt found in abundance in their subterranean realm.
